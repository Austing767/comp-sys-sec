  <title>Protocols</title>

  <introduction>
				<p>
				Protocols can be though of as rules that dictate communication. A protocol may include information about the syntax used, error correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication occurs in the context of that situation. In computer security it is important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their weaknesses often determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols exist for both hardware and software and have been developed via individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often developed on mailing lists using Requests for Comments (RFCs). You may still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. 
					<url href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616">Some of the earliest web protocols are detailed in RFCs.</url> More often than not, large protocols have working groups and associations developing, such as the 802.11 group at the 
					<url href="https://www.ieee.org/">Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</url> which handles WiFi protocols. These groups publish papers detailing how the protocols work.

				This chapter will give a brief description of important protocols following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important to note that some of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks. In this case they will be grouped according to which layer they largely function within.

						<p><idx>ARP</idx>
						<term>Address Resolution Protocol</term> (<term>ARP</term>) is used on the local ethernet segment to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. Since this protocol functions at the ethernet segment level, security was not a primary concern. Unfortunately this means that ARP communications can be easily spoofed to cause a MitM scenario. A malicious actor simply sends out several ARP packets, 
							<em>gratuitous arp</em>, saying that traffic for a certain IP address should be sent to them. Since the MAC to IP address table is cached in several places, it can take a long time for all the caches to invalidate and resolve an issue caused by malicious ARP frames.

						There is a protocol designed to mitigate the issues with ARP. 
						<term>Dynamic ARP Inspection</term> <term>(DAI)</term> reaches across layers to work with the DHCP lease database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a DHCP lease was granted. While this can solve many of the issues associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure higher-level protocols such as HTTPS just in case.

						The <term>Wifi protocols</term> we are most concerned with are the security standards used to encrypt data. By the nature of a wireless protocol, information sent on the network is available to anyone with an antenna. These Wifi security standards are the only thing protecting your network traffic from being viewing by anyone within your transmitting range. There are currently four standards:

						<term>IP</term> stands for internet protocol and it was devised to allow creating a network of networks. The network of networks that uses it primarily is the Internet, although you could use IP in other scenarios as well. IP is largely concerned with 
							<term>routing</term> traffic across and to networks. The protocol was first detailed by the IEEE in 1974 and comes from the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) project, which created the first large, packet-switched network.

						Most people are familiar with IP addresses, the unique number given to a host participating in an IP network. Currently there are two main versions of the IP protocol, IPv4 and IPv6, and one of the major differences is in how many IP addresses are available. IPv4 supports 32 bit addresses and IPv6 supports 128 bit addresses. To give an idea of how big of a change that is, we have currently allocated all possible IPv4 addresses, but with IPv6 we could give an address to every grain of sand on the beaches of earth and still not run out.

						<!--</div attr= class="title">-->
						<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p><idx>Network Address Translation</idx>
						From a security standpoint, the way addresses are used in IPv4 vs IPv6 has big consequences. Since there aren’t enough IPv4 addresses a typical internet user is assigned a local address that gets translated to an external IPv4 address when they route their packets through their router. This is referred to as 
						<term>Network Address Translation</term> <term>(NAT)</term> and is usually handled by an all-in-one device that also makes sure external entities cannot connect to the internal network.
					</p>
						<!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->
						<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>

						With IPv6 addresses each host on that same 
							<term>internal</term> network can be given an external IPv6 address. A 
							<term>basic</term> IPv6 router may simply pass the packets to the network without blocking connections to the internal network. If the machines are not hardened or a firewall is not put in place/enabled the machines could be subject to attack.
					
						</p>
						<!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->
						<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>
						As a computer security specialist it is important to test not only IPv4 connectivity, but also IPv6 to ensure that your network is configured appropriately.

						<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p><idx>destination unreachable</idx><idx>ICMP</idx>
						<term>Internet Control Message Protocol</term> <term>(ICMP)</term> is largely used to send messages between systems when IP doesn’t work. For example, lets say we tried to connect to a host but our router doesn’t know how to get there. Our router can send us an ICMP 
							<term>Destination Unreachable</term> message to let us know that something is going wrong. Because ICMP messages work at the network layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue with the internet layer.
					
						</p>
						<!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->
						<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>
						The most common use for ICMP is the 
							<c>ping</c> command. 
							<c>ping</c> sends an ICMP echo request to check to see if a host is up. By responding to the request with the data included in the request we can assume that the host is up and functioning.

						<p><idx>TTL</idx>
						ICMP is also used in the 
							<c>traceroute</c> command. 
							<c>traceroute</c> incrementally increase the <term>Time To Live</term> <term>(TTL)</term> field of ICMP packets and watches for 
							<term>TTL Exceeded</term> messages to determine what route packets are taking to get to a host. Example

						Despite the usefulness of ICMP, ICMP packets from external sources are often ignored. Network engineers use ICMP to troubleshoot their own networks, but it would be a security issue to allow outside parties to do the same. As such, do not expect all external hosts to respond to pings. They may still be up, but you’ll need to figure out

						Network address translation (NAT) is primarily used to allow local IP address to share a public IPv4 address. Given the lack of IPv4 address space many devices have to share a single address. As mentioned when discussing IPv6, NAT routers often also include security features such as a stateful firewall as the complexity of the hardware required to perform NAT is equivalent to what would be needed for a firewall.

						<term>Transmission Control Protocol</term> (<term>TCP</term>) is at the heart of most networks. It provides for reliable communication via a three way hand shake, breaks large data segments into packets, ensures data integrity, and provides flow control for those packets. This all comes at a cost of course, and this connection-oriented protocol typically has higher latency than its counterparts. Given the complex nature of TCP is has often been targeted for attacks. TCP stacks are constantly adapting and changing (within the parameters of the protocol) to avoid DoS and MitM attacks.^[

						<term>User Datagram Protocol</term> (<term>UDP</term>) is a connectionless protocol designed for instances where TCP may have too much latency. UDP achieves this performance boost by not having handshaking or flow control. The result is a speedy protocol that sometimes drops datagrams. UDP is often used as the basis for gaming or streaming protocols where the timing of the packets is more important that whether or not they all arrive. UDP does still employ checksums so you can be sure of the integrity of any UDP packets that you do receive.

						<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>
						<term>Port numbers</term> are used in a transport layer connection to specify which service to connect to. This allows a single host to have multiple services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are 
							well-known ports and typically support a commonly used service. In most operating systems it takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen for connections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not require administrative privileges to run a service on. You may find many things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them. Lastly ports 49152 to 65535 are used dynamically by applications as needed.
					
						</p>
						<!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->

							<idx>DNS</idx>
						<term>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol</term> (<term>DHCP</term>) is used to allow new clients on a network to obtain an IP address and information about services provided. IPv4 addresses can be thought of as being in two groups: static addresses and dynamic addresses. Dynamic addresses are distributed by a DHCP server for a particular lease time. When the time is up, the DHCP server may distribute the address to another client. DHCP servers can also give information about proxies, 
						<term>Domain Name Servers</term> (<term>DNS</term>), gateways and even where to get a

						Given the dynamic nature of modern networks, with clients coming and going, DHCP is the standard. From a security standpoint someone impersonating a DHCP server can wreak havoc on a network. These rogue DHCP servers can cause traffic to be redirected to initiate MitM attacks or cause DoS attacks. DHCP relies on broadcast 
						<term>Address Resolution Protocol</term> (<term>ARP</term>) messages and does not make use of authentication, meaning that once an attacker is on the same Ethernet segment as the victim machines all bets are off.

						<p><idx>headers</idx>
						Both requests and responses can take advantage of

A modern web request/response usually has far more information in the headers than just the basics defined in HTTP 1.1. Unencrypted HTTP traffic is sent over port 80 and is vulnerable to attack as all information is sent in cleartext.

It is a general purpose protocol, designed as a layer through which other protocols communicate. Some protocols typically wrapped in TLS include HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, VoIP, and many VPN protocols. TLS uses a handshake to exchange certificate information as shown in the diagram. It should be noted that at the time of writing TLS 1.3 is the most current version, but only half of websites support it. TLS 1.2, the most common version, is still considered safe if best practices are followed and TLS 1.1 or lower is considered depreciated.

HTTPS traffic uses port 443 and is typically signified in a browser with a lock icon in the upper left-hand corner. By clicking on the icon users can learn more about the certificates being used for communication. Utilizing a robust PKI HTTPS allows for safe HTTP communication between client and server.

						<term>Remote Desktop Protocol</term> (<term>RDP</term>) is build into Windows and is typically used to control a machine remotely. It works over port 3389 via TCP or UDP. While RDP can be quite useful for performing remote administration on a remote machine, it can also be a large security hole if a bad actor gains access. RDP use in ransomware attacks is on the rise as ransomware programs may use RDP to find other machines to attack.

						<term>Domain Name System</term> (<term>DNS</term>) is used to resolve domain names to IP addresses. Domain names are the simple names people are accustomed to for websites, such as 
							<c>njit.edu</c> as opposed to 
							<c>54.83.189.142</c>. Names are significantly easier for people to remember than IP addresses. In order for a computer to resolve a name, it first queries a local cache, then its primary DNS server. Assuming the DNS server cannot find the name it will query a Root server for a 
							<term>Top Level Domain</term> (<term>TLD</term>) server, which maintains a listing of Authoritative Nameservers for that particular domain (edu, com, net, org, gov, etc.). Finally once an authoritative nameserver is found it will respond with the IP address for that particular hostname which will be cached and sent back through the user’s primary DNS server to the user.

						DNS is designed to be resilient and decentralized but unfortunately the traffic is not authenticated or encrypted. This has made it a target for MitM attacks. Likewise cache hits and misses 
							<url href="https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00509">can yield information as to what names have been recently resolved</url> (as was the case in discovering the extent of the Sony Rootkit). The recursive nature has of DNS has also allowed for DoS attacks in the past, but much of that has been solved by limiting recursive queries to the user-facing DNS servers (ie. the one given to you by your DHCP request). DNS operates via UDP (and occasionally TCP) on port 53.

						<term>Internet Message Access Protocol</term> (<term>IMAP</term>) and <term>Post Office Protocol 3</term> (<term>POP3</term>) are two protocols used to retrieve email from a server. IMAP is the more recent protocol which supports saving mail on the sever and folders. POP3 is more primitive, supporting only the retrieval (and subsequent deletion from the server) of emails. Both protocols use cleartext and are now commonly run over TLS. POP3 defaults to TCP port 110 or 995 if using TLS. IMAP defaults to TCP port 143 or 993 if using TLS. In the age of webmail it is easy to forget about these protocols, but a security specialist must keep them in mind as they may still be used in support of corporate devices.

						<term>Simple Mail Transfer Protocol</term> (<term>SMTP</term>) is used for sending/forwarding email. As it states, it is a simple protocol consisting of lines of text.

SMTP servers accept outgoing mail from (hopefully) authenticated clients, route mail to other SMTP servers based on the

						<term>Network Time Protocol</term> (<term>NTP</term>)  uses UDP over port 123 to sync the system time with a time server. NTP servers are layered in stratums, with the lowest stratums being closest to the most accurate sources of time, atomic clocks, GPS, etc. NTP is important as many protocols, including several key exchanges, require system clocks to be in sync. System clocks are also used to check when certificates expire and used in logs to indicate when something happened. Without an accurate, synchronized system clock many things will fail in surprising ways.

							<idx>FTP</idx>
						<term>File Transfer Protocol</term> (<term>FTP</term>) is a relatively simple, text-based protocol for sending files between machines. FTP uses TCP on port 21 and traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and one binary channel for data. The interesting thing about this setup is that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel from server to client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the client couldn’t be easily reached behind a firewall it would fail. The solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel established by the client.
					</p>
						<!--</div attr= class="paragraph">-->
						<!-- div attr= class="paragraph"-->
						<p>
						Despite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly popular and is still used in many corporate environments. You may see FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to update firmware in embedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline client, 
							<c>ftp</c>, a graphical client such as Filezilla or SecureFX, or even in most web browsers with the 
							<c>ftp://</c> URL scheme.

						<term>Simple Network Management Protocol</term> (<term>SNMP</term>) is used for gathering information about the workings of a network. It is broken into two groups: clients using UDP port 161 (TLS 10161) and a manager using UDP port 162 (TLS 10162). The manager collects messages from the clients regarding the operations of the network and uses this information to take actions as necessary. SNMP can be used to pass information about the temperature of a machine, how many connections it currently has, the channel capacity currently being utilized, etc. SNMP is currently up to version 3 which is encrypted and requires authentication. This is particularly important because SNMP is a very powerful protocol which exchanges information that could potentially be very valuable to an attacker. Access to SNMP should be limited and its usage on a network should be monitored.

					By default, nmap uses a 
						<url href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchnetworking/definition/SYN-scanning">SYN</url> scan against well known ports. This type of scan is harder to detect (as it does not fully open a connection) and can be run quickly.
