::: {.paragraph}
*Information security* (infosec) is largely the practice of preventing
*unauthorized access* to data. Unauthorized access is when an actor
gains access to data that they do not have the permissions to access.
The system is often used in an unintended manner to provide such access.
Data has become an increasingly valuable asset and the *risks* of others
having access to data are incredibly high. Because of this, information
security typically falls under the risk-management plan of a company and
its importance cannot be understated. This is evidenced by the fact that
information technology's (IT) typical role in a company has migrated
from a basic service provider to directorships with a seat at the
highest decision making table. This is directly due to the fact that IT
assets have become the most valuable things many companies own. Guarding
these assets and managing the inherent risk of their loss is the job of
information security professionals.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
*Malicious software*, also referred to as malware, is often employed to
help an attacker gain access to a system. Many types of malicious
software exist, but the common thread is that they perform actions that
cause harm to a computer system or network. In the case of many attacks,
*system failure* may occur either as an intended (as is the case in
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks) or unintended consequence. This means
the system will no longer be able to perform its intended purpose.
System failure is a serious risk that needs to be managed.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 1.2. Learning the Lingo {#_learning_the_lingo}

::: {.paragraph}
In general, the technical fields are laden with acronyms and obtuse
vocabulary. Unfortunately security is no exception to this rule. Three
of the most important acronyms you should be aware of to start are
*CIA*, *AAA*, and *DRY*.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 1.2.1. CIA {#_cia}

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![cia](images/cia.svg){width="300" height="128"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
While the Central Intelligence Agency does have a role to play in
information security, for our purposes CIA is an acronym used to
remember the three foundational information security principles:
confidentiality, integrity, and availability. These ideas form the
cornerstone of security and should be ever-present in your thoughts.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
*Confidentiality* refers to the practice of keeping secret information
secret. For example, if an e-commerce site stores credit card numbers (a
questionable practice to begin with) those credit card numbers should be
kept *confidential*. You would not want other users of the site or
outsiders to have access to your credit card number. Many steps could be
taken to ensure the confidentiality of user credit card numbers, but at
this point it is enough to understand that maintaining confidentiality
is a principle of security.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
*Integrity* is an assurance that data has not been corrupted or
purposefully tampered with. As we discussed previously, data is very
valuable, but how valuable is it if you can't be sure it is intact and
reliable? In security we strive to maintain integrity so that the system
and even the controls we have in place to guard the system can be
trusted. Imagine that e-commerce site again. What would happen if an
attacker could arbitrarily change delivery addresses stored in the
system? Packages could be routed to improper addresses and stolen and
honest customers would not receive what they ordered, all because of an
integrity violation.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
*Availability* means that a system should remain up and running to
ensure that valid users have access to the data when needed. In the
simplest sense, you could ensure confidentiality and integrity by simply
taking the system off line and not allowing any access. Such a system
would be useless and this final principle addresses that. Systems are
designed to be accessible and part of your security plan should be
ensuring that they are. You will need to account for the costs of
implementing confidentiality and integrity and make sure that the
resources are available to keep the system working. In an extreme case,
denial of service (DoS) attacks can actually target availability. By
keeping this principle in mind, hopefully you can mitigate some of those
risks.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 1.2.2. AAA {#_aaa}

::: {.imageblock .left}
::: {.content}
![aaa](images/aaa.svg){width="200" height="128"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Another acronym you're going to encounter in many different contexts is
AAA. It stands for *Authentication*, *Authorization*, and *Accounting*
and it is used in designing and implementing protocols. These concepts
should be remembered when designing security plans.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Authentication is the process of confirming someone's identity. This may
be done with user names and passwords or more frequently via
multi-factor authentication (MFA) which requires not only something you
know, but something you have (fingerprints, key fob, etc.).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Authorization refers to keeping track of which resources an entity has
access to. This can be done via a permission scheme or access control
list (ACL). Occasionally you will encounter something more exotic where
authorization limits users to interactions during a particular time of
day or from a particular IP address.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Accounting refers to tracking the usage of resources. This may be as
simple as noting in a log file when a user has logged in to keeping
track of exactly which services and user uses and how long they use
them. Accounting is incredibly important because it allows you to not
only monitor for possible problems, but also inspect what has occurred
*after* a problem is encountered. Accounting also allows system
administrators to show irrefutably what actions a user has taken. This
can be very important evidence in a court of law.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 1.2.3. DRY {#_dry}

::: {.paragraph}
While we're dispensing knowledge in the form of three letter acronyms
(TLAs), another important acronym to keep in mind is DRY: Don't Repeat
Yourself.
:::

::: {.quoteblock}
> Say something once, why say it
> again?^\[[1](index.html#_footnotedef_1 "View footnote."){#_footnoteref_1
> .footnote}\]^

::: {.attribution}
--- Talking Heads\
Psycho Killer
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
This is of course not entirely literal. Just because you've explained
something to a coworker once does *not* mean that you shouldn't explain
it again. It is meant as more of a guide for how you make use of
*automation* and how you design systems. Increasingly security experts
are not being asked to analyze a single system, but a network of
hundreds if not thousands of systems. In this case you should make use
of scripts and tools to make sure you are not manually doing the same
thing over and over. Have you found a good way of testing to see if a
part of a system is secure? Put it in a script so that you can reuse the
test on other systems. This same logic applies to how systems are
designed. Do you have a database of user login info? Reuse that database
across multiple systems. In short, \"Don't repeat yourself!\"
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 1.3. Hacker Culture {#_hacker_culture}

::: {.paragraph}
The term *hacker* comes from the sound that programmers would make when
typing or *hacking* away at keyboards. Originally a hacker was anyone
who worked feverishly at a problem on a computer and the term *cracker*
was used to define people who attempted to bypass security systems. The
distinction was eventually lost and a hacker has come to be the popular
term for someone attempting to gain unauthorized access to data. For an
interesting glimpse into early hacker culture/reasoning read [The
Conscience of a
Hacker](https://archive.org/stream/The_Conscience_of_a_Hacker/hackersmanifesto.txt)
by The Mentor originally published in Phrack Magazine 1986.

Hacker Hats
:::

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![hats](images/hats.png){width="450"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
An early attempt at classifying hackers involved assigning hat colors
according to their motivations. This harkens back to the old western
movies where the bad guys wore black hats and the good guys wore white
hats. Just as in real life nothing is clearly black and white, as such
we've laid the traditional roles on a two-axis continuum from malicious
to benevolent and illegal to legal.
:::

::: {.dlist}

White Hat

:   These hackers are typically employed by a company to test the
    security of their systems. They operate legally with the intent of
    ultimately improving security.

Black Hat

:   These hackers operate outside the bounds of the law, and as such are
    subject to prosecution. Their intent is nefarious usually involving
    personal profit, malice, or some combination of the two.

Gray Hat

:   A gray hat hacker operates illegally but ultimately wants to improve
    the security of the system. They may inform administrators of the
    details of their breach or they may be acting to force a group to
    better secure their system. In rare circumstances a gray hat hacker
    may actually exploit a system for the purposes of hardening it once
    they have gained administrative access. It should be noted that
    despite the good intentions, gray hat hackers are still operating
    illegally and may be subject to prosecution.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
There are several more hat distinctions (blue hats, green hats, etc.)
with mixed meanings. For example a blue hat may refer to an external
entity hired by a company to test the security of a component, as is the
case in Microsoft, or it may refer to a hacker motivated by revenge. It
is also worth nothing that the second quadrant of our graph is empty,
but this does not mean that there aren't malicious, legal hackers. These
may be software developers exploiting legal loopholes or possibly even
individuals working for another government engaged in cyber warfare.

### 1.4. Threat Actors {#_threat_actors}

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
To better be able to manage the risks of a data breach, it helps to be
able to identify/understand the attacker or threat actor involved. Just
as there are many reasons an actor may attempt to gain unauthorized
access there are also many groups of threat actors.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Neophytes making use of automated tools that they may not fully
understand are often referred to a *script kiddies*. You may hear other
pejorative names as well such as lamer, noob, or luser, but the common
thread is that these threat actors are *not* highly sophisticated. The
same techniques used for automating defensive security can also be
applied to automating attacks. Unfortunately this means that you may
encounter actors \"punching above their weight\" or using complex tools
while having only a rudimentary understanding of what they do.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Hacktivist are threat actors that attack to further social or political
ends. These groups can be very sophisticated. The most well known
hacktivist group is *Anonymous* which has been linked to several
politically motivated attacks.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Organized crime is another element which may employ or support threat
actors typically to make money. These groups typically have access to
more resources and contacts than a solo actor. It is important to note
that threat actors with roots in organized crime may find it easier to
migrate into other areas of crime due to their proximity to a large
criminal enterprise. For example, while it may be difficult for a script
kiddie to broker the sale of valuable data, a hacker working with an
organized crime syndicate may have people close to them that are
familiar with the sale of stolen goods.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The last group of threat actors, and arguably the group with the most
resources, are threat actors working with or for governments and nation
states. These groups may have the explicit or implicit permission of
their country to commit cyber crimes targeting other nations. Given the
constant threat and resources available to these groups, they are
referred to as an advanced persistent threat (APT). By utilizing the
resources of a nation (often including its intelligence and military
resources) APTs are a severe threat.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 1.5. Security Plans {#_security_plans}

::: {.paragraph}
While confronting such a diverse array of actors can seem daunting at
first, the key element to being successful is having a plan. A *security
plan* analyzes the risks, details the resources that need to be
protected, and presents a clear path to protecting them. Typically a
security plan utilizes the three types of security controls available:
physical, administrative, and technical.
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   Physical controls are things like door locks, cameras, or even the
    way rooms in a building are laid out. These things can have a
    dramatic impact on the overall security and should not be
    overlooked!

-   Administrative controls include human resources policies (HR),
    classifying and limiting access to data, and separating duties. It
    helps to have a whole-organization understanding of security to make
    it easier to put these controls in place.

-   Technical controls are often what new security professionals think
    of first. These are things like intrusion detection systems (IDS),
    firewalls, anti-malware software, etc. While these are an important
    segment of security and they are the segment that falls almost
    entirely within the purview of IT, it is critical to remember that
    these are only as strong as the physical and administrative controls
    that support them!
:::

::: {.admonitionblock .warning}
  -- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Physical controls definitely lack the cool factor that technical controls have. Movies typically show security professionals hunched over laptops typing frantically or scrolling rapidly through pages and pages of logs on a giant screen. Rarely do they show them filling out a purchase order (PO) to have a locksmith come in and re-key the locks to the data closet. Just because it isn't cool doesn't mean it isn't important! Remember, once an attacker has physical access, anything is possible.

::: {.sect2}
### 1.6. Tools of the Trade {#_tools_of_the_trade}

::: {.paragraph}
With all of this talk regarding how and why hackers attack systems, the
question remains, \"What can be done?\" There are a few tools the
security professional employs that are worth mentioning at this juncture
including: *user awareness*, *anti-malware software*, *backups*, and
*encryption*.
:::

::: {.dlist}

User Awareness

:   A major risk, some would argue the biggest risk, is that unprepared
    users will run malware programs or perform other harmful actions as
    directed by actors looking to gain access. These actors may
    impersonate others or perform other *social engineering* tactics to
    cause users to do as they say. Probably the scariest statistic is
    the ease with which a massive attack requiring little effort can be
    performed. Threat actors do not even need to personally reach out to
    users, they could simply send a mass email. Through training
    programs and other methods of interaction a security professional
    can make users aware of these threats and train them to act
    accordingly. Raising user awareness is a critical component of any
    security plan.

Anti-Malware Software

:   Given how prevalent the use of malware is a host of tools have been
    developed to prevent its usage. These tools may filter download
    requests to prevent downloading malware, monitor network traffic to
    detect active malware patterns, scan files for malware signatures,
    or harden operating system loopholes used by malware. A security
    plan will typically detail the type of anti-malware software being
    used as well as the intended purpose of its usage.

Backups

:   Maintaining a copy of the data used by a system can be a quick
    solution to the problems of ransomware and other attacks aimed at
    causing or threatening system failure. While a backup does not solve
    the problem of the data being sold or used by others, it does allow
    for a quick recovery in many instances and should be part of a
    security plan.

Encryption

:   At its most simple, encryption obfuscates data and requires a key to
    make it useful. Encryption can be employed to make copies of data
    obtained through unauthorized access useless to attackers that do
    not have the key. Often, encryption and backups complement each
    other and fill in the use cases that each lacks individually. As
    such, encryption will show up multiple times and in multiple ways in
    an average security plan.

### 1.7. Lab: Think Like a Hacker {#_lab_think_like_a_hacker}

::: {.paragraph}
For this lab, we will be engaging in a thought experiment. Imagine you
are at a university that is having a student appreciation breakfast. At
the entrance to the cafeteria an attendant has a clipboard with all of
the student IDs listed. Students line up, show their ID, and their ID
number is crossed off of the list.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Thinking like a hacker, how would you exploit this system to get extra
free breakfasts? Feel free to think outside the box and make multiple
plans depending on the circumstances you would encounter when go the
breakfast.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Here is an example that you *can not* use:
:::

::: {.sidebarblock}
::: {.content}
::: {.paragraph}
I would tell the attendant that I forgot my ID, but I know my number and
then give someone elses number. This is very similar to logging in to
systems by claiming the user has forgotten their password and then
knowing the answers to the security questions required to change the
password.

2. Cryptography {#_cryptography}
---------------

::: {.sectionbody}
::: {.paragraph}
This chapter is meant to serve as a brief and gentle introduction to the
cryptographic concepts often encountered in the field of security. It is
by no means exhaustive but it should provide a basis for a better
understanding of why protocols are designed the way they are.
Cryptography is a method of scrambling data into non-readable text. It
allows us to transform data into a secure form so that unauthorized
users cannot view it.
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.1. Why do we need cryptography? {#_why_do_we_need_cryptography}

::: {.paragraph}
Cryptography is used to set up secure channels of communication, but it
can also be used to provide non-repudiation of actions, basically
leaving digital footprints that show someone did something. This means
that cryptography allows us to provide authentication, authorization,
*and* accounting (AAA).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
By using a secure and *confidential* encrypted channel we can be sure
that anyone who intercepts our communications cannot \"listen in.\" This
helps prevents *man-in-the-middle (MITM)* attacks. Cryptography can also
be used to provide *integrity*: proving that the data is valid. With
cryptography you can provide a *signature* for the data showing that the
person who claims to have sent it really did send it. Cryptography also
allows for *non-repudiation* as it can show that only one person was
capable of sending a particular message. Lastly cryptography also allows
us to perform authentication *without* storing passwords in plaintext.
This is critical in an age where data breaches are increasingly common.

Case Study: Equifax
:::

::: {.paragraph}
[In September of 2017, Equifax announced a data breach the exposed the
personal information of 147 million
people.](https://www.ftc.gov/enforcement/cases-proceedings/refunds/equifax-data-breach-settlement)
The original attack made use of an exploit in an outdated version of
[Apache Struts](https://struts.apache.org/) which was being used as part
of Equifax's system for handling credit disputes from customers. Once
the attackers had gained access to internal Equifax servers, the began
gathering as much information as they could from internal databases.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
What is particularly egregious about this data breach is that passwords
in many databases were stored in plaintext. This means that the
attackers were able to try the passwords and usernames on other
services. While it is important that users use different passwords for
different services it is far more disturbing that a company as large as
Equifax did not have the policies in place to use cryptography to
mitigate the risks from such an enormous breach.
:::

### 2.2. Terminology {#_terminology}

::: {.paragraph}
Going forward, it is important to address some common cryptography terms
as they will be used frequently:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Plaintext

:   [unencrypted information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext),
    data that is \"in clear\", or cleartext

Cipher

:   [an algorithm for performing encryption or
    decryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher)

Ciphertext

:   data that has undergone encryption

Cryptographic algorithm

:   a series of steps to follow to encrypt or decrypt data

Public key

:   information (typically a byte array) that can be used to encrypt
    data such that only the owner of the matching *private key* can
    unencrypt it

Private (secret) key

:   information (typically a byte array) that can be used to decrypt
    data encrypted using the corresponding public key
:::

::: {.exampleblock}
::: {.title}
Example 1. Caesar Cipher
:::

::: {.content}
::: {.paragraph}
One of the most basic examples of encryption is the Caesar cipher, or
substitution cipher. It is easy to understand, compute, and trivial to
crack. Let's create a table that maps every letter in the alphabet to a
different letter:
:::

| A   | B   | C   | D   | E   | F   | G   | H   | I   | J   | K   | L   | M   | N   | O   | P   | Q   | R   | S   | T   | U   | V   | W   | X   | Y   | Z   |
|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| J   | G   | T   | Q   | X   | Y   | A   | U   | C   | R   | V   | I   | F   | H   | O   | K   | L   | E   | D   | B   | W   | S   | Z   | M   | N   | P   |

::: {.paragraph}
Now creating a message is simple a matter of performing the
substitutions. For example, `HELLO WORLD` becomes `UXIIO ZOEIQ`.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
While this is simple to understand and set up, it is also very easy to
break. You could use a frequency attack, where you analyze a large chunk
of encrypted text knowing that certain letters are more frequent than
others. By matching up the most frequently used ciphertext letters with
their standard English equivalents you may quickly reach a solution. You
could also go through all permutations of the alphabet (4E26) and see
what gives you the most English words. The second attack is made much
more feasible through computing.
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.3. Keys {#_keys}

::: {.paragraph}
Typically a series of random bytes can be used as a key to either
encrypt or decrypt data. A key is used by a cryptographic algorithm to
change plaintext to ciphertext. Keys may also be asymmetric in that they
can only be used to perform *one* of the operations (either encryption
or decryption).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
It is important to have an idea of what factors make a *strong*
cryptographic key. Length plays an important role. The longer the key,
the hard it is to *crack* the encryption. Likewise the randomness of the
data in the key also makes it stronger. If the byte sequence is somehow
predictable, the length is irrelevant. Finally we have the concept of a
cryptoperiod or lifetime of a key. If we are working with a system that
frequently changes keys an attacker may not have enough time to crack
it.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.4. Mathematical Foundation {#_mathematical_foundation}

::: {.paragraph}
Cryptography relies largely on the concept of one-way or trap door
functions. That is a process that is hard to compute in one direction,
but easy to compute in the other. For example it is much easier for a
computer to multiply large numbers than to determine the factors of
large numbers. This is the foundation of the RSA algorithm. [A
simplified version of the
algorithm](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~jpopyack/IntroCS/HW/RSAWorksheet.html)
is shown below:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
KEY GENERATION
p = a random prime number
q = a random prime number
N = p * q
r = (p - 1) * (q - 1)
K = a number which equals one when modded by r and can be factored
e = a factor of K that doesn't share factors with N
d = another factor of K that doesn't share factors with N
Your public key is N and e
Your private key is N and d

ENCRYPTION
ciphertext = (cleartext**e)%N

DECRYPTION
cleartext = (ciphertext**d)%N

EXAMPLE
p = 7
q = 13
N = 7 * 13 = 91
r = 72
K = 145 (because 145%72 = 1)
e = 5
d = 29
Public Key = 91, 5
Private Key = 91, 29
cleartext = 72 ('H' in ASCII)
ciphertext = (72**5)%91 = 11 (encrypted using N and e)
cleartext = (11**29)%91 = 72 (decrypted using N and d)
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In order to *crack* RSA you would need to be able to factor N into its
two prime numbers. While it is trivial in our simple example, imagine
how difficult it would be to [factor a number with 1400 decimal
digits,](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11832022/why-are-large-prime-numbers-used-in-rsa-encryption)
the current recommended keysize for RSA. You'll notice that the
algorithm only requires exponentiation, multiplication, and modulus
arithmetic. At no point do you ever have to factor a large prime number
to generate keys, encrypt, or decrypt. You only have to perform that
operation if you're trying to work backwards without the keys.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Other similar one-way function exist based on elliptical curves. It
turns out that motion along an elliptical curve can be described
according to a start and end point and several iterations of a simple
algorithm. You can reconstruct the initial conditions if you know the
start point, end point, and how many iterations it took. If all you know
is the start and end point you can't determine the initial conditions.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.5. Hashes {#_hashes}

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![hash](images/hash.svg){width="300" height="144"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A hashing algorithm is a one-way function that creates hashed text from
plaintext. It is often used for data validation as a relatively small
hash *digest* or *signature* can demonstrate the integrity of a large
block of data. Hashes can also be used so that sensitive information
does not have to be stored in cleartext. By storing a hash of a
password, you can check to see if the correct password was entered
without storing the password itself. In the case of a data breach only
the hashes are leaked and the attacker does not have access to the
passwords to try with other services.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Two main families of hash algorithms are used: MD5 and SHA. MD5 produces
a 128-bit hash value and is still often used to verify data integrity.
The algorithm is technically cryptographically broken, but you may still
see it in use. The SHA family of algorithms consists of SHA-1, SHA-2,
and SHA-3:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   SHA-1: 160 bits, similar to MD5, designed by the NSA, no longer
    approved for cryptographic use

-   SHA-2: SHA-256 and SHA-512, very common with the number indicating
    the block size, designed by the NSA

-   SHA-3: non-NSA designed, not widely adopted, similar numbering
    scheme as SHA-2 (SHA3-256, etc.)
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Dictionary based attacks against password hashes are fairly common.
Typically software is used which generates a hash for every word in the
dictionary and then compares that hash to what is stored on the
compromised machine. One way to combat this is through salting or adding
random bits to each password. When salting the bits are stored with the
hash. This forces a dictionary based attack to actively generate the
hashes based on what the salt is as opposed to using a stored table
(rainbow table) of all the possible hashes. It can make attacks go from
instant to days or even years depending on the complexity of the
password.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
An even better way of combating attacks against hashes is through a
secret salt or *pepper*. A pepper is a random value that is added to the
password but not stored with the resulting hash. The random value can be
stored in a separate medium such as a hardware Security Module.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.6. Symmetric Encryption {#_symmetric_encryption}

::: {.imageblock .left}
::: {.content}
![symmetric](images/symmetric.svg){width="550" height="144"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Symmetric encryption is probably the simplest encryption to understand
in that it only uses a single key (in this case our key is labelled
\'A\') to encrypt or decrypt data. Both parties need to know the private
key in order to communicate. It does pose a security risk in that if the
channel used for key exchange is insecure, all of the messages can be
decrypted. That being said, given that it is simpler than many other
forms of encryption, it is often used for secure communication or
storage.
:::

::: {.exampleblock}
::: {.title}
Example 2. One-time-pad
:::

::: {.content}
::: {.paragraph}
One-time-pad (OTP) is a rare example of a pen and paper, symmetric
encryption scheme that cannot be cracked. The difficulty in OTP mirrors
the difficulty with all symmetric encryption, namely that pre-shared
keys need to be exchanged at some point.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Imagine that a prisoner wishes to send encrypted messages to someone
outside the prison. To do so, they will make use of a copy of Harry
Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone that they have in their cell. The
message they want to send is \"DIG UP THE GOLD\". They turn to \"Chapter
One: The Boy Who Lived\" and look up the first twelve letters in the
chapter: MR AND MRS DURS. For each letter of their message, they convert
it to its number in the alphabet: 4 9 7 21 16 20 8 5 7 15 12 4 (DIG UP
THE GOLD). They do the same for the key they looked up in their book: 13
18 1 14 4 13 18 19 4 21 18 19 (MR AND MRS DURS). Finally they add the
two numbers to get their ciphertext: 17 27 8 35 20 33 26 24 11 36 30 23.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
If the prisoner sends that ciphertext to someone on the outside who
knows that they key is the first chapter of Harry Potter and the
Sorcerer's Stone, they will be able to subtract the key from each of the
numbers in the ciphertext and discover the plaintext message. While
theoretically unbreakable, anybody else who has the key can recover the
text as well. This means that using common keys like popular books make
it trivial for a man-in-the-middle to decode the ciphertext. After all,
the warden probably knows every book that the prisoner has in their
cell.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
OTP has been used by spy agencies, often for communications between
individuals via dead-drops. In this situation tables of random
characters printed in duplicate are exchanged as the key.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.7. Asymmetric Encryption {#_asymmetric_encryption}

::: {.imageblock}
::: {.content}
![asymmetric](images/asymmetric.svg){width="700" height="144"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
An asymmetric encryption algorithm has actually already been
demonstrated in the [Mathematical
Foundation](index.html#_mathematical_foundation) section. Asymmetric
encryption has a public key which can be published anywhere and used to
encrypt messages that only the holder of the private key, which is not
published, can unencrypt. For example if you want to receive encrypted
emails you may make your [GNU Privacy Guard (GPG)](https://gnupg.org/)
public key available a [public key
server](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/). This would allow anyone to look
up your public key, encrypt a message that only you can read, and send
you the ciphertext. Asymmetric encryption gets around the difficulties
of key exchange via an untrusted channel (like email). Unfortunately the
cost of such a useful system is that asymmetric algorithms tend to be
much slower that their symmetric counterparts.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.8. Stream Ciphers {#_stream_ciphers}

::: {.paragraph}
Stream ciphers encode data one symbol at a time and produces one
ciphertext symbol for each cleartext symbol. Given that you can often
use some sort of block encryption with a significantly small block size,
stream encryption is not used as often. Technically the OTP example,
when used one symbol at a time, is a stream cipher. The keys come in one
symbol at a time, the cleartext comes in one symbol at a time, and an
operation is performed (addition in the case of the example) to create
the ciphertext. Given a suitable keysize and a well-researched
algorithm, stream ciphers can be just as secure as block ciphers. That
being said a stream cipher is usually more consistent in its runtime
characteristics and typically consumes less memory Unfortunately there
are not as many well-researched algorithms and widely used stream
ciphers.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 2.9. Block Ciphers {#_block_ciphers}

::: {.paragraph}
Block ciphers takes the data in, in blocks and use cipher blocks of the
same size to perform the encryption. It is very popular and there are
many secure algorithms to choose from. Unfortunately if the input data
doesn't fit neatly into blocks of the same size, padding may be
required, which takes up more space/memory and reduces the speed of the
cipher. As such the block encryption is often less performant than
stream encryption.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 2.9.1. Block Cipher Modes of Operation {#_block_cipher_modes_of_operation}

::: {.paragraph}
There are several ways you can create your cipher blocks and depending
on how you do it, various attacks are possible:
:::

::: {.sect4}

Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The simplest mode of operation, data is divided into blocks and each
block is encoded using a key. Since the blocks are encoded the same way,
identical blocks will give identical ciphertexts. This makes it easier,
given enough data, to determine what the key is.
:::
:::

##### Cipher block chaining (CBC) {#_cipher_block_chaining_cbc}

[WhiteTimberwolf (SVG

Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Starting with an initialization vector (IV) each block is XORed with
part of the ciphertext of the previous block to create a chain of
ciphertext that is constantly changing. This means that identical blocks
will result in *different* ciphertexts. This is the most common mode of
operation, its weaknesses being that the algorithm cannot be run in
parallel (sorry modern processors) and that the IV is a common attack
target.
:::

##### Counter (CTR) {#_counter_ctr}

[WhiteTimberwolf (SVG
version)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CTR_encryption_2.svg),
Public domain, via Wikimedia Commons
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Instead of using an IV, CTR uses a nonce (random number that is the same
for all blocks) and counter. The counter is incremented with each block,
meaning this mode can function in parallel. CTR mode solves the problems
of ECB while still providing an algorithm that can run quickly on modern
machines.

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
GCM uses a counter like CTR, but does not make use of a nonce. Instead
an IV is used with the inititial counter. GCM also generates a message
authentication code (MAC) for each block to verify the integrity of the
block. This combination makes for a modern, robust algorithm that is
gaining rapid adoption.

Case Study: Exploiting Non-Rolling Codes
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The importance of non-repeating codes, such as the counter codes used in
the CTR and GCM block cipher modes of operation can be highlighted
through analysis of another important technology that uses codes:
keyless entry systems. When garage door openers first came on to the
market, the remote would broadcast a single code that the receiver was
programmed to recognize as correct. This meant that anyone listening in
could easily get the code and replay the code to open the garage door
with their own
device.^\[[2](index.html#_footnotedef_2 "View footnote."){#_footnoteref_2
.footnote}\]^ To combat this, companies began using [rolling
codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_code) in their remotes and
receivers. Given the same seed a rolling code allows each device to
generate a sequence of codes that are exactly the same. The remote will
use the next code in a sequence every time the button is hit. The
receiver will validate the recieved code if it matches any of the next
several codes in the sequence (in case the button was hit a few times
out of range). This effectively mitigates the replay attack.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Given that this was implemented in the 1980s with garage door remotes,
you would assume car manufacturers employ the same technology in their
remotes. In a case of \"everything old is new again\" this isn't true.
[Blake Berry (HackingIntoYourHeart) discovered that several makes and
models of cars are actually still vulnerable to a replay
attack.](https://github.com/HackingIntoYourHeart/Unoriginal-Rice-Patty/blob/main/README.md)
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Sammy Kamkar also discovered a vulnerablility for rolling codes, named
RollJam, which he demonstrated at DEF CON 23. Kamkar's device jams
signals sent by a keyfob, while recording the codes being sent. Once it
has two codes recorded, presumably from the victim pressing the button
multiple times, it stops jamming, sends out the first code to unlock the
car and stores the second code to unlock the car at a later time.

### 2.10. Encryption Examples {#_encryption_examples}

::: {.sect3}
#### 2.10.1. RSA {#_rsa}

::: {.paragraph}
RSA is an asymmetric encryption standard developed in 1977 that is still
very popular. Its trapdoor function is based on the difficulty of
factoring large numbers. The name RSA comes from the names of the
authors of the system: Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 2.10.2. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) {#_advanced_encryption_standard_aes}

::: {.paragraph}
AES is a symmetric block cipher developed in 1998 to supersede the less
secure Data Encryption Standard (DES). AES works on 128 bit blocks of
data, performing multiple rounds of substitution-permutation to encrypt
data. You will find AES used to encrypt network traffic (as is the case
in a virtual private network), data stored to disk (disk encryption), or
computer game data that is saved to storage. AES is a *very* common
cipher.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 2.10.3. Elliptic-curve Cryptography (ECC) {#_elliptic_curve_cryptography_ecc}

::: {.paragraph}
ECC is an asymmetric encryption scheme that is quite fast and easy to
computer. It is rapidly becoming the go to choice for digital signatures
and key exchanges, gaining adopting starting in 2004. ECC is based on
the geometry of a pre-determined set of curves (some examples can be
found [here](http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf)), which can be used to
create a trapdoor function.

::: {.paragraph}
Given the slow nature of asymmetric algorithms, often an application
such as a VPN will choose to use asymmetric cryptography to exchange a
shared secret key and then use that secret key with a faster symmetric
algorithm such as AES. Diffie-Hellman does exactly that and was first
published in 1976. Diffie-Hellman key exchange uses the same
mathematical concepts as RSA, exponentiation and modulus arithmetic, to
great effect, but to visualize what is happening a metaphor of secret
color mixing is used (see the included diagram). It is important to
remember that because the medium of exchange may be slow a DH key
exchange is designed to generate minimal traffic.
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 2.10.5. Digital Certificates {#_digital_certificates}

::: {.paragraph}
A digital certificate is a set of credentials used to identify a company
or an individual. Since asymmetric encryption requires know a party's
public key, a digital certificate includes that key as well as an ID of
the owner. The question then becomes how do you trust that the public
key is *actually* for the alleged owner? That's where the issuing
authority comes in. A *certificate authority (CA)* signs the certificate
indicating that the ID and public\_key are correct. Certificates can be
self-signed, but this sidesteps the trust placed in the CA and is often
only used in testing. Since most certificates are used for encrypting
web traffic, Web browsers will typically warn you if a site is using a
self-signed certificate.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Given how how many certificates need to be issued and the work that
needs to be done to verify them, most certs are not issues by root CAs,
but are actually issued by intermediate CAs. Root CAs delegate the work
to Intermediate CAs and indicate their trust in them by signing the
intermediate CAs keys. This creates a *chain of trust* from the issued
certificate (signed by the Intermediate CA) to the Intermediate CA
(signed by the root CA) to the root CA (trusted by the browser). Tools
that use this chain of trust will keep the root CA certificates and
update them from the companies that issue them as needed.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The certificate store is very important and while users rarely interact
with it is often possible to install root CAs manually. [This is can be
used to create a proxy that can decrypt HTTPS traffic for
debugging](https://docs.telerik.com/fiddler/configure-fiddler/tasks/trustfiddlerrootcert)
or for more nefarious purposes. For this reason some applications,
Facebook mobiles apps for example, maintain their own certificate store
and prevent users from adding root CAs to it.

So how do you get a certificate for your website? The customer will
generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that includes the public
key and their ID. The CA will validate that the customer owns the
website and build and sign the cert. This whole process can be automated
and performed for free via a tool called [Let's

It is hard to talk about cryptography without addressing blockchains,
one of the concepts behind cryptocurrencies. A blockchain is a shared
ledger (of transactions in the case of BitCoin) where blocks are
constantly being added to add to the information being stored.
Periodically an new block is created, which includes a hash of the
previous block and a hash of itself for the next block to reference. By
examining these hashes, you can prove the integrity each block and its
position, thus making a publicly-available, mutually agreed upon
accounting of what has occurred on the network. Typically to prevent bad
actors from adding block some sort of proof of work, a mathematically
difficult operation, or proof of stake, an accounting of investment in
the network, must be included when adding a block to the chain.

#### 2.10.7. Trusted Platform Module (TPM) / Hardware Security Module (HSM) {#_trusted_platform_module_tpm_hardware_security_module_hsm}

::: {.paragraph}
These modules provide hardware specifically for use with encryption.
HSMs are removable modules while TPMs are motherboard chips. Many
ciphers rely on a reliable source of entropy (randomness) which these
modules provide. They can also significantly increase the speed at which
cryptographic algorithms run by moving the operations to specialized
hardware. Lastly, these modules can be used to store keys *and* make
them only accessible via the module. This can add an extra layer of
security to prevent the keys from being easily copied.

images, or even [plain
text!](https://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/crypt/snow/description.html).
The hidden data can also be encrypted if an additional layer of security
is required. In the field of security, malicious code may be hidden
inside other files using steganographic techniques. This makes it more
difficult for tools to find them when searching storage.

### 2.11. Lab: Hash it Out {#_lab_hash_it_out}

::: {.paragraph}
A *hash* is a one-way cryptographic function that produces a *unique*
set of characters for a given *message*. In a perfect world, given a
hash you should *not* be able to determine what the original message
was, but given a hash and the original message you can check that the
hash matches the message. Before we dive into the uses of a hash, lets
try to further understand it by looking at a simple and consequently
poor hashing
algorithm.^\[[3](index.html#_footnotedef_3 "View footnote."){#_footnoteref_3
.footnote}\]^
:::

::: {.paragraph}
**Anagram Hash**
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Let's assume we wanted to hash the message \"Hello from Karl\" so that
we can have a string of characters the uniquely represent that phrase.
One way to do it would be to strip all the punctuation in the message,
make everything lowercase, and then arrange all the letters
alphabetically. \"Hello from Karl\" becomes \"aefhklllmoorr\". You can
think of it like saying, \"There is one \'a\' in the message, one \'e\'
in the message, one \'f\' in the message\', one \'k\' in the message,
three \'l's in the message...​\" Now our hash, \"aefhklllmoorr\", can be
used to uniquely identify the phrase.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Now assume Karl wants to send us a message but he can't trust the person
sending the message. He could use the untrusted party to send us the
message and then put the hash someplace public like on a website. We
could use the hash to know the message came from Karl *and* if anyone
else got the hash they would not be able to discern the message because
a hash is a one-way function. \"aefhklllmoorr\" reveals very little
about the message, but it can be used to check its accuracy.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Hopefully this is beginning to show the power of hashes. Now lets
examine another very common usecase and find out exactly why this is a
terrible algorithm.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Assume you run a website where a user uses a password to log in. You
want to make sure users are using their password when they log in, but
you do not want to store the password on your website. This is quite
common. If you website was breached you don't want to leak a bunch of
people's passwords. What do you do? What you could do is store a hash of
their password, hash the password when they try to login, and compare
the hashes. For example if our password was \"password\" using our basic
hash algorithm the hash would be \"adoprssw\". We could store
\"adoprssw\" in our database, use it for comparison during login, and if
someone were to ever steal the data in our database they wouldn't know
that the original password is \"password\". This may prevent an attacker
from exploiting the fact that many people use the same password on
multiple sites.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The problem is that there are many things that hash to \"adoprssw\"
including \"wordpass\", \"drowsaps\", or even the hash we're storing:
\"adoprssw\". When multiple messages have the same hash it is referred
to as a *collision* and this particular algorithm is useless because it
generates so many of them.

**MD5**

For this section, we are going to be using Docker and a terminal.
[Please follow these directions for installing
Docker.](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) For Windows you can use
the [Windows Terminal
app](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701)
and in MacOS you can use the preinstalled Terminal app. Gray boxes show
the commands as typed into the terminal with typical output where
possible. Your prompt (the part shown before the command) may differ
depending on your OS.

MD5 is a message-digest algorithm that produces significantly better
hashes than our Anagram algorithm. Most Linux distributions include a
simple utility for creating an MD5 hash based on a file's contents. This
command is named md5sum. Typically this is used to detect if a file has
been tampered with. A website may provide links to download software as
well as an MD5 hash of the files so that you know what you've downloaded
is correct. Similarly a security system may keep md5sums (MD5 hashes) of
certain critical files to determine if they have been tampered with by
malware. Let's practice taking the md5sum of the `/etc/passwd` file:
:::

::: {.listingblock}

hashes.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
**Hash Cracking**
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Passwords in a Linux system are hashed and stored in the `/etc/shadow`
file. Let's print out the contents of that file to see how it looks:
:::

::: {.listingblock}

:::
:::

::: {.colist .arabic}
  ------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **1**   As you can see here the `karl` user has a long hash immediately after their username
  ------- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

::: {.paragraph}
One of the problems with hashes are that if people choose simple
passwords, they can be easily cracked by a program that takes a wordlist
of common passwords, generates their hashes, and then checks to see if
the hash is the same. While a hash may be a one-way function, it is
still subject to this type of attack. We're use a program called [John
the Ripper](https://www.openwall.com/john/) and do exactly that.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
John the Ripper is already installed on this container along with a
simple wordlist. We will tell it to use the default wordlist to try and
determine what the password is that matches karl's hash in
`/etc/shadow`:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@8e0962021f85:/# john --format=crypt --wordlist=/usr/share/john/password.lst /etc/shadow
Loaded 1 password hash (crypt, generic crypt(3) [?/64])

Use the "--show" option to display all of the cracked passwords reliably
Session completed
```
:::
:::

::: {.admonitionblock .note}
  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Once john has cracked a password it will not show it if you run it again. To *show* the passwords that have already been cracked you must run the `--show` command with the file: `john --show /etc/shadow`
  -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Given that the password is in the included common password wordlist,
`/usr/share/john/password.lst`, you will quickly find that John the
Ripper figures out that karl's password. John the Ripper can also run
incrementally though all the possible character combinations, but it
takes much longer. To help make these types of attacks more difficult,
every hash in `/etc/shadow` is built off of a random number. This number
is called a *salt* and is stored with the hash. This means that instead
of just trying one hash for each word in the wordlist, the hash cracker
must try every possible salt for every word in the wordlist, slowing
things down significantly. Modern hash crackers may use [rainbow
tables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table) so that all of the
possible hashes have already been computed. These tables may take up
terabytes of disk space, but can make cracking even complicated hashes
much simpler.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Let's use a custom utility named `` `crypt `` to show that we have the
actual password. This utility is already installed on your container. We
will start by printing out just the line in `/etc/shadow` that has
karl's info. We will use the `grep` command to limit out output to
things that have `karl` in them:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@7f978dd90746:/# cat /etc/shadow | grep karl
karl:$y$j9T$oR2ZofMTuH3dpEGbw6c/y.$TwfvHgCl4sIp0b28YTepJ3YVvl/3UyWKeLCmDV1tAd9:19255:0:99999:7:::
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The first part of the shadow line is the username, karl. The next part
of the shadown line, immediately following the first colon, is the hash
information. The characters in between the first set of `$` is the
version of the hashing algorithm being used, `y` for yescrypt in our
case. The characters in between the second set of `$` are the parameters
passed to yescrypt which will always be `j9T` for us. The characters in
between the third set of `$` is your salt. Finally the characters in
between the fourth set of `$` is the hash.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The \[`crypt`\] utility calls the system
[`crypt`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/crypt.3.html) command
and prints the output. Let's run this utility with the password we've
cracked and the first three parts of the hash information from
`/etc/shadow`. If everything goes well, you should see hash output that
matches what is in `/etc/shadow`:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@7f978dd90746:/# crypt <karl's password> '$y$j9T$oR2ZofMTuH3dpEGbw6c/y.' (1)

### 3.1. What is malware? {#_what_is_malware}

::: {.paragraph}
Malware is a portmanteau of the words *malicious* and *software*. The
term is used to describe many different types of *intentionally
malicious* programs. One of the key differences between malware and just
plain bad software is the intentional aspect of its creation. Malware is
designed to damage or exploits computer systems. It often spies on,
spams, or otherwise damages target or host machines.

Malware Distribution by OS (Q1

.footnote}\]^
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The most popular target for malware is the Windows OS by quite a large
margin. This is due largely to its popularity as a desktop operating
system. The second largest target is web browsers, which afford malware
a unique cross-platform reach. The third largest target is the Android
mobile operating system, which while technically Linux runs mostly on
mobile phones. Both Linux and Mac do not receive as much malware
attention. While this may be partially due to the open-source nature of
Linux and the BSD kernel used by Macs, it is also partially due to the
lack of popularity of each of these operating systems. Malware is often
widely distributed, meaning it can target only the most popular/possibly
weakest links and still be successful.

Zero Days
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Modern operating systems employ layers of security to ensure that
programs do not have access to sensitive information or applications.
This typically means that for malware to be effective, it needs to
elevate its privileges. The most effective malware can perform privilege
escalation without requiring user interaction. To do this malware may
rely on new/undocumented exploits or vulnerabilities. These new exploits
that have been disclosed for \"zero days\" are hence are referred to as
*zero days*. Zero days are incredibly powerful and may be hoarded by
APTs/criminal groups or sold for millions of dollars on the Dark Web.
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 3.3. Types of Malware {#_types_of_malware}

::: {.paragraph}
The definition of malware is so broad and new malware is being created
daily. This can make it difficult to classify malware. As we go through
some basic types, please keep in mind that there is significant overlap.
For example, you may encounter ransomware distributed as a virus *or*
ransomware distributed as a trojan. The fact that it is ransomware does
not preclude it from being some other type of malware as well.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.3.1. Worms, Viruses, and Trojans {#_worms_viruses_and_trojans}

::: {.paragraph}
Worms are self-propagating programs that spread without user
interaction. Their code is typically stored within an independent
object, such as a hidden executable file. Worms often do not severely
damage their host, as they are concerned with rapid, exponential
spreading.
:::

::: {.exampleblock}
::: {.title}
Example 3. Stuxnet
:::

::: {.content}
::: {.paragraph}
Stuxnet was a 2010 worm that specifically targeted Iranian nuclear
facilities. The worm used an unprecedented four zero-day attacks and was
designed to spread via USB flash drives and Remote Procedure Calls
(RPCs). In this way it didn't just rely on networks to propagate.
Ultimately Stuxnet's payload targeted the code used to program PLC
devices that control motors and make them spin too fast, destroying the
centrifuges. Stuxnet also employed an impressive rootkit to cover its
tracks. Given the level of sophistication Stuxnet is believed to have
been developed by the US and Israel.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Viruses typically require user interaction, such as copying and infected
file from one machine to another, and store their code inside another
file on a machine. An executable file may be infected by having the
virus code added a separate page that executes before the standard
program code. Viruses can be quite damaging to the host as they may take
significant resources to spread locally. The term virus is also an
unfortunately overloaded one. Due to it's popularity it is often used by
some lower-skill threat actors to refer to many different types of
malware.
:::

::: {.exampleblock}
::: {.title}
Example 4. Concept Virus
:::

::: {.content}
::: {.paragraph}
The Concept virus was the first example of a Microsoft Word macro virus.
The virus hid itself inside Microsoft Word files and used Word's
embedded macro language to perform its replication tasks. Viruses were
later created for Excel and other programs that had sufficiently
sophisticated yet ultimately insecure internal scripting languages.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A trojan is a form of malware that disguises itself as legitimate
software. It does not have to rely on a software exploit as much as it
exploits users into installing, running, or giving extra privileges to
the malicious code. Trojans are the most popular kind of malware as they
can be used as an attack vector for many other payloads. The name comes
from Greek mythology, where a Trojan horse was disguised as a gift and
given to a besieged town. Within the large horse were secret troops who
came out in the middle of the night and opened the town gates.
:::

::: {.exampleblock}
::: {.title}
Example 5. Emotet
:::

::: {.content}
::: {.paragraph}
Emotet is a banking trojan from 2014 that spread through emails. It made
use of malicious links or macro-enabled documents to make the user
download its code. Emotet has been one of the most costly and
destructive pieces of malware currently averaging about one million in
incident remediation. It continues to be adapted to avoid detection and
make use of even more sophisticated malware.

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files and demands a ransom
to decrypt them. Modern ransomware uses symmetric encryption to the
files quickly and then encrypts the symmetric key asymmetrically using a
hard-coded public key for which the threat actor has the corresponding
private key. When the ransom is paid, typically via cryptocurrency, the
threat actor can decrypt the symmetric key using their private key and
the user can use the symmetric key to decrypt the files.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Ransomware is considered a data breach in the data is often exfiltrated
as well. It is also worth noting that when the ransom is paid, there is
no guarantee that the threat actor will actually begin the decryption
process. Typical targets of ransomware include corporate infrastructure
and health care systems although ransomware may also be spread
indeterminately. The payout of ransoms can be a large money-making
enterprise so many APTs or criminal groups may employ its use.
Ransomware is considered the biggest threat to cyber stability today.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.3.3. Spyware {#_spyware}

::: {.paragraph}
Malware specifically designed for espionage/data theft is known as
spyware. Like ransomware, spyware can also have a monetary payoff for
the threat actor. Actors may use extortion to demand payment or the data
will be *leaked*. This typically means either sold on the dark web or
publicly posted. Once again, given the possibility of monetary gain,
spyware is often associated with criminal groups. APTs may use spyware
as well to obtain secrets of national importance.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Customer data, trade secrets, proprietary data, and government secrets
are all targets of spyware. Even outside of governments systems, in the
corporate setting, spyware is still a major threat.

Fileless Malware
:::

::: {.imageblock .text-center}
::: {.content}
![fileless](images/fileless.svg){width="776" height="272"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Malware is often detected by scanning storage for files that match a
particular hash or by looking in files to see if they contain patterns.
Both of these detection techniques rely on the malware being stored in a
file. Fileless malware attempts to avoid detection by leaving no
footprint in the file system. This type of malware uses legitimate
processes to load itself into memory, often with a registry key created
to reload every time the machine is restarted. This creates a
persistent, hard-to-detect type of malware that is often used by
sophisticated threat actors such as APTs and criminal groups.
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.3.4. Cryptojacking {#_cryptojacking}

::: {.paragraph}
Crypto currencies utilizing proof-of-work algorithms have made it easier
than ever for programs to convert processor cycles into money. Certain
types of malware capitalize on this by mining cryptocurrency in the
background on a users machine. This theft of power and resources can
result income for the malware distributor when the funds from mining are
deposited into their online wallet.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Cryptojacking is more popular than ever, especially considering that
large botnets of infected machines have already been created.
Cryptojacking creates a simpler path to monetization for malicious
actors who may already have control of many compromised machines.

:::

::: {.paragraph}
A rootkit is a secret program designed to give back door access to a
system. They are designed to remain hidden and may even actively disable
or circumvent security software. Due to their low-level nature, many
rootkits can be difficult to detect and even more difficult to remove.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Rootkits are often classified in accordance with the layer in which they
are hidden:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Firmware Rootkit

:   Firmware is code that a hardware device uses to run. It is often a
    thin layer of commands used for setting up and interfacing with the
    device. A firmware rootkit may reside in the BIOS of a motherboard
    and can be very difficult to remove.

Bootloader Rootkit

:   A bootloader prepares the system to boot an operating system kernel,
    typically by loading the kernel into memory. A bootloader rootkit
    may hijack this process to load itself into separate memory space or
    manipulate the kernel being loaded.

Kernel-mode Rootkit

:   Many operating system kernel, including Linux, have the ability to
    load dynamic modules. These kernel modules have complete access to
    OS kernel operations. A kernel-mode rootkit can be difficult to
    detect live as the OS kernel being given the instructions to detect
    the rootkit can no longer be trusted.

Application Rootkit

:   An application or user-mode rootkit is usually installed as an
    application that runs in the background with administrative
    privileges. These rootkits are typically the easiest to develop and
    deploy, a low-level knowledge of the hardware the system is using is
    not required, but they are also the easiest to detect and remove.

Sony Rootkit
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In 2005 Sony released CDs for their music software with an application
rootkit designed to run on Microsoft Windows systems. The rootkit ran
persistently in the background, slowing systems, and did not have an
uninstaller to remove the program. It was designed to prevent the OS
from copying information from audio CDs, but it also opened up several
security holes that could be exploited by other malware. Ultimately the
rootkit led to several class-action lawsuits against Sony BMG and a led
to a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that required Sony to
reimburse customers who reported damages from the rootkit.

#### 3.3.6. Botnet {#_botnet}

::: {.paragraph}
A botnet is a network of exploited hosts controlled by a single party.
These hosts may be desktop computers, servers, or even internet of
things (IoT) devices. Botnets are often used in large-scale distributed
denial of service (DDoS) attacks where the nature of the attack is to
have many machines flooding a single machine with traffic. Botnets may
also be used to send spam emails as their access to SMTP email relay may
vary depending on their internet service provider (ISP).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Bots are typically controlled through a command and control (C2, C&C)
server. While this C2 server may use a custom protocol, it is far more
typical for modern botnets to rely on other infrastructure. C2 traffic
can use SSH, HTTP, Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or even Discord to send
commands to bots and receive data from bots.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.3.7. RAT {#_rat}

::: {.paragraph}
RAT stands for Remote Access Trojan an it is used to gain full access
and control of a remote target. The malware distributor can browse the
files on a computer, send keystrokes and mouse movements, view the
screen, and/or monitor the input from the microphone and camera. RATs
often actively bypass security controls and as such they may be
difficult to detect.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.3.8. Adware / Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP) {#_adware_potentially_unwanted_programs_pup}

::: {.paragraph}
Adware is malware that is designed to track user behavior and deliver
unwanted, sometimes intrusive, tailored ads. Adware may slow down a
system and/or add ad walls to sites. This type of malware often targets
a users web browser.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP) are typically downloaded as part of
the install of another program. Commons PUPs are browser toolbars, PDF
readers, compression utilities, or browser extensions. These programs
may have adware/spyware components in them and can also slow down a
system.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 3.4. Indicators of Compromise {#_indicators_of_compromise}

::: {.paragraph}
An *indicator of compromise (IoC)* is an artifact with high confidence
the indicates an intrusion. It is a way to tell if a machine has been a
victim of malware. IoCs are publicly communicated by security
professionals in an effort to help mitigate the effects of malware.
:::

::: {.dlist}
::: {.title}
Common IoC Types
:::

Hash

:   A hash of files that are known to be malicious. This can help in
    identifying trojans and worms.

IP addresses

:   Tracking the IP addresses which malware connects to can be used to
    determine if a machine is infected.

URLs/Domains

:   Tracking the URLs or domains that malware uses can also be used to
    determine if a machine is infected.

Virus definition/signature

:   Executables and other files can be scanned for specific sequences of
    bytes which are unique to a particular virus. In this way even if
    the malware is hiding within another file, it can still be detected.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 3.5. Delivery of Malware {#_delivery_of_malware}

::: {.paragraph}
Malware is often delivered through social engineering, namely convincing
an actor within an organization to download and run or click on
something. It can also delivered through infiltrating the software
packages something depends on, supply chain, or possibly through a
software exploit on an publicly exposed service. Some of the most common
ways of spreading malware are detailed below.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.5.1. Phishing {#_phishing}

::: {.paragraph}
Phishing involves communicating with someone via a fraudulent message in
an effort to make them perform and action that will harm them. It is
broken into five main categories:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Spear phishing

:   Sending phishing emails or other communications that are targeted
    towards a particular business or environment. These messages may
    include information about the inner workings of the organization in
    an attempt to prove their validity. They may also take advantage of
    a known, insecure practice at a particular organization. Spear
    phishing is not your standard wide-net phishing attempt, but more of
    a focused, tailored, custom campaign.

Whaling

:   Targeting high-ranking individuals at an organization. Whaling is
    often used in conjunction with spear phishing.

Smishing

:   Using SMS messages when phishing.

Vishing

:   Using voice messages when phishing.

Phishing sites

:   Threat actors can attempt to gain unauthorized access through
    information obtained from non-business related communication
    channel. For example, malicious actors may know that the CEO
    frequents a popular sailing forum. These actors could set up an
    account on the sailing forum to direct message the CEO for
    information.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.5.2. SPAM {#_spam}

::: {.paragraph}
SPAM consists of large quantities of unsolicited emails. These emails
may be malicious or they may simply be advertising. In either case SPAM
accounts for nearly 85% of all email. It is interesting to note that
sometimes the malware distributed through SPAM is actually used to send
more SPAM through a victim's machine. The war on SPAM is constantly
evolving and while many updates have been made to the way we send email,
many improvements have yet to be realized.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.5.3. Dumpster Diving {#_dumpster_diving}

::: {.paragraph}
Information that can ultimately lead to the spread of malware can also
be found in improperly disposed trash. Old records or hard drives may
contain corporate secrets or credentials that give someone unauthorized
access. It is important to properly dispose of sensitive information,
making sure that all things that need to be destroyed are destroyed in a
complete manner.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.5.4. Shoulder Surfing {#_shoulder_surfing}

::: {.paragraph}
PINs, passwords, and other data can also recovered simply by looking
over someone's shoulder. These credentials could be the \"in\" that an
attacker needs to spread malware. Through the aid of optics, such a
binoculars, shoulder surfing can even occur at a long distance. Privacy
screens, which limit the angle at which you can see a monitor, can be
helpful in mitigating this type of attack.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.5.5. Tailgating {#_tailgating}

::: {.paragraph}
Following behind someone who is entering a secure location with a
credential is known as tailgating. Often people will even hold secure
doors open for someone if they have their hands full. It is human nature
to want to help people, but you also must remember that the person
behind you may have a USB key with malware ready to deploy as soon as
they gain physical access to a machine in the building.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.5.6. Impersonation/Identity Theft {#_impersonationidentity_theft}

::: {.paragraph}
Often as part of a phishing campaign, a threat actor will pretend to be
someone else. This may be someone within the organization or someone
with sufficient power outside the organization, such as a representative
of a government oversight agency. Attackers may also use stolen
credentials to make their messages appear official, once again giving
them and easy route through which to deploy malware.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 3.6. Cyber Killchain {#_cyber_killchain}

::: {.imageblock .text-center}
::: {.content}
![killchain](images/killchain.svg){width="608" height="272"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
One way of analyzing an attack involving malware is through the steps of
the Cyber Killchain. The Cyber Killchain was developed by Lockheed
Martin and is a military method of analysis that has been adopted by
cybersecurity. Cyber Killchain is broken into seven steps: Recon,
Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and
Control, and Exfiltration.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.6.1. Recon {#_recon}

::: {.paragraph}
Recon is short for reconnaissance, military parlance for a preliminary
survey used to gain information. During the recon phase, a malicious
actor will gather as much information as possible. Methods used in this
phase may be passive or active.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Passive recon involves gathering information *without* sending anything
to the target. This typically involves accessing publicly available
information, such as social media, published websites, and DNS records.
If the actor has access they may also passively sniff network packets.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Active recon involves interaction with the target. This can include port
scanning, vulnerability scanning, [brute forcing directories and
filenames on an HTTP server](https://www.kali.org/tools/dirbuster/), or
even contacting workers. Active recon can yield more information, but it
is also significantly easier to detect.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.6.2. Weaponization {#_weaponization}

::: {.paragraph}
In the weaponization phase the actor begins readying exploits for the
vulnerabilities that were assessed during recon. This may include
tailoring malware, creating phishing emails, customizing tools, and
preparing an environment for the attack. For malware to be effective it
must utilize the correct exploits and work under the correct OS and
environment. [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) is a penetration
testing framework that is often used in this step to create custom
malware.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.6.3. Delivery {#_delivery}

::: {.paragraph}
During the delivery phase the malware is handed over to the target.
Typically steps are taken to bypass detection systems. Delivery may
involve the sending of emails linked to malware or the exploitation of
vulnerable servers to then run malware. At the end of this phase, an
attacker typically waits for a callback from the malware via the command
and control channel.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.6.4. Exploitation {#_exploitation}

::: {.paragraph}
Technically the exploitation step occurs once the malware is
successfully executed. In many cases, this involves almost no
interaction from the attacker. Once malware is activated or the payload
of an exploit executed, the *victim* has completed the exploitation
step.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.6.5. Installation {#_installation}

::: {.paragraph}
The installation step is typically performed by the malware once it is
running. The malware installs itself, hides itself, and sets up
persistence (the ability to restart after being stopped). The malware
may escalate privilege or move laterally. It may also install second
stage additional payloads from a remote server. A common tactic is
injecting downloaded code into an existing process to mask which process
is performing questionable actions.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.6.6. Command and Control (C2, C&C) {#_command_and_control_c2_cc}

::: {.paragraph}
Malware will reach out via its Command and Control channel for more
instructions. At this point an attacker may interact with the malware,
giving it additional commands. C2 traffic is usually designed to blend
in with existing traffic and not draw attention.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 3.6.7. Exfiltration / Actions & Objectives {#_exfiltration_actions_objectives}

::: {.paragraph}
The final step involves getting data from the exploited systems or
disabling/misusing the systems in another way. At this point an attacker
can use the C2 channel to pull sensitive information from the system,
credit card information, password hashes, etc. Its important to not that
exfiltration of data may not be the only goal of the attack. An attacker
can also disable the system, commit fraud with the system, mine crypto
currencies, etc. At this point the malicious actor is in complete
control of the exploited system.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 3.7. Lab: Malware Analysis {#_lab_malware_analysis}

::: {.paragraph}
The website [Any Run](https://any.run) offers free interactive malware
analysis. We will be using this site to avoid the complications of
running malware in a VM.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Start by visiting [Any Run](https://any.run) and registering for an
account with your NJIT email address. Once you have activated your
account via email, follow the tutorial to learn how to analyze threats.
Use the demo-sample task provided by Any Run. Follow the prompts and
watch how the process tree changes. Feel free to take your time, even
after the time expires you will still be able to look at the running
processes and analyze HTTP Requests, Connections, DNS Requests, and
Threats.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
For this lab we are going to look at an example of
[Emotet](https://www.malwarebytes.com/emotet), a banking Trojan
discovered in 2014. On the left-hand side of the Any Run site, click on
*Public tasks* and search for the md5 sum
`0e106000b2ef3603477cb460f2fc1751`. Choose *one* of the examples (there
are three) and look through the screenshots to get an idea of how the
malware is run. It may also help to glance at the network traffic
processes.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Run the VM live by clicking *Restart* in the upper right-hand corner.
Perform the actions necessary to trigger the malware, adding time as
needed. Finally open notepad on the VM, type in your name, and take a
unique screenshot.

4. Protocols {#_protocols}
------------

::: {.sectionbody}
::: {.paragraph}
Protocols can be though of as rules that dictate communication. A
protocol may include information about the syntax used, error
correction, synchronization, or any other aspect of how communication
occurs in the context of that situation. In computer security it is
important to have a thorough understanding of common protocols as their
weaknesses often determine how and if an attack will occur. Protocols
exist for both hardware and software and have been developed via
individuals and organizations. Early networking protocols were often
developed on mailing lists using Requests for Comments (RFCs). You may
still see RFCs being crafted, referred to, or actively worked on. [Some
of the earliest web protocols are detailed in
RFCs.](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616) More often than
not, large protocols have working groups and associations developing,
such as the 802.11 group at the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers (IEEE)](https://www.ieee.org/) which handles WiFi protocols.
These groups publish papers detailing how the protocols work.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
This chapter will give a brief description of important protocols
following the TCP/IP layering model. It is important to note that some
of these protocols may reach across layers to accomplish tasks. In this
case they will be grouped according to which layer they largely function
within.
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 4.1. Network Access Layer {#_network_access_layer}

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.1.1. ARP {#_arp}

::: {.paragraph}
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used on the local ethernet segment
to resolve IP addresses to MAC addresses. Since this protocol functions
at the ethernet segment level, security was not a primary concern.
Unfortunately this means that ARP communications can be easily spoofed
to cause a MitM scenario. A malicious actor simply sends out several ARP
packets, *gratuitous arp*, saying that traffic for a certain IP address
should be sent to them. Since the MAC to IP address table is cached in
several places, it can take a long time for all the caches to invalidate
and resolve an issue caused by malicious ARP frames.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
There is a protocol designed to mitigate the issues with ARP. Dynamic
ARP Inspection (DAI) reaches across layers to work with the DHCP lease
database and drop packets that are not using the MAC address used when a
DHCP lease was granted. While this can solve many of the issues
associated with ARP it is also a good practice to use secure
higher-level protocols such as HTTPS just in case.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.1.2. Wifi {#_wifi}

::: {.paragraph}
The Wifi protocols we are most concerned with are the security standards
used to encrypt data. By the nature of a wireless protocol, information
sent on the network is available to anyone with an antenna. These Wifi
security standards are the only thing protecting your network traffic
from being viewing by anyone within your transmitting range. There are
currently four standards:
:::

::: {.dlist}

WEP

:   Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is depreceated and should not be
    used. It was developed in 1999 and uses an RC4 stream and 24-bit
    encryption. Several attacks have been developed that can crack WEP
    within a matter of seconds.

WPA

:   Wifi Protected Access (WPA) utilized Temporal Key Integrity Protocol
    (TKIP) to change the keys being used. This 128-bit encryption method
    has also been cracked and the protocol should not be used.

WPA2

:   Wifi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) makes use of AES encryption and is
    currently the most popular standard. WPA2 is still considered
    secure.

WPA3

:   Wifi Protected Access 3 (WPA3) was developed in 2018 and is
    currently considered state-of-the-art. Many networks are beginning
    the transition from WPA2 to WPA3.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 4.2. Internet Layer Protocols {#_internet_layer_protocols}

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.2.1. IP {#_ip}

::: {.paragraph}
IP stands for internet protocol and it was devised to allow creating a
network of networks. The network of networks that uses it primarily is
the Internet, although you could use IP in other scenarios as well. IP
is largely concerned with *routing* traffic across and to networks. The
protocol was first detailed by the IEEE in 1974 and comes from the
Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) project, which
created the first large, packet-switched network.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Most people are familiar with IP addresses, the unique number given to a
host participating in an IP network. Currently there are two main
versions of the IP protocol, IPv4 and IPv6, and one of the major
differences is in how many IP addresses are available. IPv4 supports 32
bit addresses and IPv6 supports 128 bit addresses. To give an idea of
how big of a change that is, we have currently allocated all possible
IPv4 addresses, but with IPv6 we could give an address to every grain of
sand on the beaches of earth and still not run out.
:::

::: {.sidebarblock}
::: {.content}
::: {.title}
IPv6 Security Implications
:::

::: {.paragraph}
From a security standpoint, the way addresses are used in IPv4 vs IPv6
has big consequences. Since there aren't enough IPv4 addresses a typical
internet user is assigned a local address that gets translated to an
external IPv4 address when they route their packets through their
router. This is referred to as Network Address Translation (NAT) and is
usually handled by an all-in-one device that also makes sure external
entities cannot connect to the internal network.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
With IPv6 addresses each host on that same *internal* network can be
given an external IPv6 address. A *basic* IPv6 router may simply pass
the packets to the network without blocking connections to the internal
network. If the machines are not hardened or a firewall is not put in
place/enabled the machines could be subject to attack.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
As a computer security specialist it is important to test not only IPv4
connectivity, but also IPv6 to ensure that your network is configured
appropriately.
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.2.2. ICMP {#_icmp}

::: {.paragraph}
Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is largely used to send
messages between systems when IP doesn't work. For example, lets say we
tried to connect to a host but our router doesn't know how to get there.
Our router can send us an ICMP *Destination Unreachable* message to let
us know that something is going wrong. Because ICMP messages work at the
network layer, we will receive this message even if there is an issue
with the internet layer.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The most common use for ICMP is the `ping` command. `ping` sends an ICMP
echo request to check to see if a host is up. By responding to the
request with the data included in the request we can assume that the
host is up and functioning.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
ICMP is also used in the `traceroute` command. `traceroute`
incrementally increase the Time To Live (TTL) field of ICMP packets and
watches for *TTL Exceeded* messages to determine what route packets are
taking to get to a host. Example `traceroute` output is shown below:
:::

  **1**   Notice these routers not responding to ICMP packets
  ------- -----------------------------------------------------
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Despite the usefulness of ICMP, ICMP packets from external sources are
often ignored. Network engineers use ICMP to troubleshoot their own
networks, but it would be a security issue to allow outside parties to
do the same. As such, do not expect all external hosts to respond to
pings. They may still be up, but you'll need to figure out [another way
to detect them.](https://nmap.org/book/man-host-discovery.html)

::: {.paragraph}
Network address translation (NAT) is primarily used to allow local IP
address to share a public IPv4 address. Given the lack of IPv4 address
space many devices have to share a single address. As mentioned when
discussing IPv6, NAT routers often also include security features such
as a stateful firewall as the complexity of the hardware required to
perform NAT is equivalent to what would be needed for a firewall.

#### 4.2.4. IPsec {#_ipsec}

::: {.paragraph}
Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is used to set up a point-to-point
encryption tunnel to secure data in transit across IP networks. IPsec is
used primarily in dedicated VPN links and makes use of three main parts:
SA, ESP, and AH:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   SA stands for security association and is a channel used to set up
    encryption parameters and exchange keys. This happens via UDP on
    port 500.

-   ESP stands for encapsulating security protocol and is used to
    encrypt IP headers and payloads. It is sent using standard IP
    packets with the protocol field set to 50.

-   AH stands for authentication header and they can optionally be used
    in standard IP packets with the protocol field set to 51. AH simply
    ensures that a packet hasn't been tampered with.

### 4.3. Transport Layer Protocols {#_transport_layer_protocols}

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.3.1. TCP {#_tcp}

::: {.paragraph}
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is at the heart of most networks. It
provides for reliable communication via a three way hand shake, breaks
large data segments into packets, ensures data integrity, and provides
flow control for those packets. This all comes at a cost of course, and
this connection-oriented protocol typically has higher latency than its
counterparts. Given the complex nature of TCP is has often been targeted
for attacks. TCP stacks are constantly adapting and changing (within the
parameters of the protocol) to avoid DoS and MitM
attacks.^\[[5](index.html#_footnotedef_5 "View footnote."){#_footnoteref_5

:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.3.2. UDP {#_udp}

::: {.paragraph}
User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol designed for
instances where TCP may have too much latency. UDP achieves this
performance boost by not having handshaking or flow control. The result
is a speedy protocol that sometimes drops datagrams. UDP is often used
as the basis for gaming or streaming protocols where the timing of the
packets is more important that whether or not they all arrive. UDP does
still employ checksums so you can be sure of the integrity of any UDP
packets that you do receive.

#### 4.3.3. Common Ports and Services {#_common_ports_and_services}

::: {.paragraph}
Port numbers are used in a transport layer connection to specify which
service to connect to. This allows a single host to have multiple
services running on it. Ports 0 to 1023 are *well-known ports* and
typically support a commonly used service. In most operating systems it
takes administrative privileges to bind to a Well-known port and listen
for connections. Registered ports range from 1024 to 49151 and do not
require administrative privileges to run a service on. You may find many
things listening on these ports as any user can have a service on them.
Lastly ports 49152 to 65535 are used dynamically by applications as
needed.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
It is important to know some commonly used ports as the services running
on these ports may be subject to an attack. When scanning a machine,
only necessary ports should be open.

#### 4.4.1. DHCP {#_dhcp}

::: {.paragraph}
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is used to allow new clients
on a network to obtain an IP address and information about services
provided. IPv4 addresses can be thought of as being in two groups:
static addresses and dynamic addresses. Dynamic addresses are
distributed by a DHCP server for a particular lease time. When the time
is up, the DHCP server may distribute the address to another client.
DHCP servers can also give information about proxies, Domain Name
Servers (DNS), gateways and even where to get a [where to get a kernel
to boot an OS over the
network!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preboot_Execution_Environment)
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Given the dynamic nature of modern networks, with clients coming and
going, DHCP is the standard. From a security standpoint someone
impersonating a DHCP server can wreak havoc on a network. These rogue
DHCP servers can cause traffic to be redirected to initiate MitM attacks
or cause DoS attacks. DHCP relies on broadcast Address Resolution
Protocol (ARP) messages and does not make use of authentication, meaning
that once an attacker is on the same Ethernet segment as the victim
machines all bets are off.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.2. HTTP {#_http}

::: {.paragraph}
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a text based protocol that governs
how web traffic moves. It is built on the concept of a *request* and a
*response*. A typical request has an *method* and a *path*, such as
`GET /index.html` which would retrieve the landing page of a website.
Responses have a code, message, and optionally data. Some standard
responses are shown below:
:::

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
| Code                              | Message                           |
+===================================+===================================+
| 200                               | OK                                |

| 503                               | Service Unavailable               |
+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

::: {.paragraph}
Both requests and responses can take advantage of *headers*, arbitrary
lines of text following the initial request or response. Since headers
were designed to be open-ended, many new headers have been added over
time. A modern web request/response usually has far more information in
the headers than just the basics defined in HTTP 1.1. Unencrypted HTTP
traffic is sent over port 80 and is vulnerable to attack as all
information is sent in cleartext.

::: {.paragraph}
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or the more modern nomenclature Transport
Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that allows cleartext protocols used
on the web to be encrypted. It is a general purpose protocol, designed
as a layer through which other protocols communicate. Some protocols
typically wrapped in TLS include HTTP, SMTP, IMAP, VoIP, and many VPN
protocols. TLS uses a handshake to exchange certificate information as
shown in the diagram. It should be noted that at the time of writing TLS
1.3 is the most current version, but only half of websites support it.
TLS 1.2, the most common version, is still considered safe if best
practices are followed and TLS 1.1 or lower is considered depreciated.

Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) solves the problem of
unencrypted traffic by wrapping HTTP requests in TLS. HTTPS traffic uses
port 443 and is typically signified in a browser with a lock icon in the

about the certificates being used for communication. Utilizing a robust
PKI HTTPS allows for safe HTTP communication between client and server.

#### 4.4.5. RDP {#_rdp}

::: {.paragraph}
Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) is build into Windows and is typically
used to control a machine remotely. It works over port 3389 via TCP or
UDP. While RDP can be quite useful for performing remote administration
on a remote machine, it can also be a large security hole if a bad actor
gains access. RDP use in ransomware attacks is on the rise as ransomware
programs may use RDP to find other machines to attack.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.6. Telnet {#_telnet}

::: {.paragraph}
Telnet is an antiquated remote administration tool that gives access to
a shell via a cleartext channel. Telnet runs on port 23 and while still
occasionally in use it should largely be phased out. You will still find
telnet in embedded applications and legacy systems. You may also see the
client being used to inspect other types of traffic. For example, you
can use a telnet client to submit HTTP requests or send email via SMTP.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.7. SSH {#_ssh}

::: {.paragraph}
Secure Shell (SSH) is the most widely deployed remote administration
tool. SSH provides access to a shell via an encrypted connection. SSH
supports many options including SOCKS5 proxies, port forwarding, and the
usage of multiple authentication schemes: password, key, hardware
device, etc. SSH uses TCP on port 22.

::: {.paragraph}
Lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP) is used for accessing and
maintaining directory information services. It's primary use is with
Windows Active Directory (AD) where it can be used to obtain information
regarding users and resources from an AD server. Clients can
authenticate through the server and obtain privileges to read or
read/write certain entries. LDAP did not originally support encryption,
so LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) was developed. LDAP uses TCP and UPD over port
389 and LDAPS uses TCP over port 636.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.9. DNS {#_dns}

::: {.paragraph}
Domain Name System (DNS) is used to resolve domain names to IP
addresses. Domain names are the simple names people are accustomed to
for websites, such as `njit.edu` as opposed to `54.83.189.142`. Names
are significantly easier for people to remember than IP addresses. In
order for a computer to resolve a name, it first queries a local cache,
then its primary DNS server. Assuming the DNS server cannot find the
name it will query a Root server for a Top Level Domain (TLD) server,
which maintains a listing of Authoritative Nameservers for that
particular domain (edu, com, net, org, gov, etc.). Finally once an
authoritative nameserver is found it will respond with the IP address
for that particular hostname which will be cached and sent back through
the user's primary DNS server to the user.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
DNS is designed to be resilient and decentralized but unfortunately the
traffic is not authenticated or encrypted. This has made it a target for
MitM attacks. Likewise cache hits and misses [can yield information as
to what names have been recently
resolved](https://kb.isc.org/docs/aa-00509) (as was the case in
discovering the extent of the Sony Rootkit). The recursive nature has of
DNS has also allowed for DoS attacks in the past, but much of that has
been solved by limiting recursive queries to the user-facing DNS servers
(ie. the one given to you by your DHCP request). DNS operates via UDP
(and occasionally TCP) on port 53.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.10. DNSSEC {#_dnssec}

::: {.paragraph}
Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) is a suite of extension
specifications designed to authenticate responses to domain name
lookups. This can help prevent MitM attacks by checking the digital
signature of the responding server. While this is certainly helpful, it
is important to note that DNSSEC does not provide confidentiality. DNS
resolutions can still be monitored by anyone who has access to the
traffic.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.11. IMAP/POP3 {#_imappop3}

::: {.paragraph}
Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) and Post Office Protocol 3
(POP3) are two protocols used to retrieve email from a server. IMAP is
the more recent protocol which supports saving mail on the sever and
folders. POP3 is more primitive, supporting only the retrieval (and
subsequent deletion from the server) of emails. Both protocols use
cleartext and are now commonly run over TLS. POP3 defaults to TCP port
110 or 995 if using TLS. IMAP defaults to TCP port 143 or 993 if using
TLS. In the age of webmail it is easy to forget about these protocols,
but a security specialist must keep them in mind as they may still be
used in support of corporate devices.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.12. SMTP {#_smtp}

::: {.paragraph}
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol is used for sending/forwarding email. As
it states, it is a simple protocol consisting of lines of text. Basic
SMTP used TCP on port 25. SMTP was later expanded to support
authentication and finally wrapped in TLS still using TCP on port 587.
SMTP servers accept outgoing mail from (hopefully) authenticated
clients, route mail to other SMTP servers based on the Mail Exchange
(MX) information in DNS records, and accept mail for their domain from
other SMTP servers. Various checks have been implemented in SMTP servers
to ensure that messages from domains *actually* come from those domains.
This is largely used to combat spam, which continues to be a problem.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.13. NTP {#_ntp}

::: {.paragraph}
Network Time Protocol uses UDP over port 123 to sync the system time
with a time server. NTP servers are layered in stratums, with the lowest
stratums being closest to the most accurate sources of time, atomic
clocks, GPS, etc. NTP is important as many protocols, including several
key exchanges, require system clocks to be in sync. System clocks are
also used to check when certificates expire and used in logs to indicate
when something happened. Without an accurate, synchronized system clock
many things will fail in surprising ways.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 4.4.14. FTP {#_ftp}

::: {.paragraph}
File Transfer Protocol is a relatively simple, text-based protocol for
sending files between machines. FTP uses TCP on port 21 and
traditionally establishes two channels: one for protocol messages, and
one binary channel for data. The interesting thing about this setup is
that the FTP server would initiate the connection of the data channel
from server to client, meaning that in many NAT situations where the
client couldn't be easily reached behind a firewall it would fail. The
solution to this problem was passive FTP which uses one channel
established by the client.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Despite this initial shortcoming, FTP has proven to be incredibly
popular and is still used in many corporate environments. You may see
FTP being used to transmit bulk data for import to systems or used to
update firmware in embedded systems. You can use FTP with a commandline
client, `ftp`, a graphical client such as Filezilla or SecureFX, or even
in most web browsers with the `ftp://` URL scheme.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Unfortunately FTP does not support authentication systems other than
passwords and the passwords are sent in plaintext. As such Secure FTP
(SFTP) is recommended. SFTP uses an SSH connection to send and receive
files over an encrypted channel. SFTP also supports all SSH
authentication methods.

10162). The manager collects messages from the clients regarding the
operations of the network and uses this information to take actions as
necessary. SNMP can be used to pass information about the temperature of
a machine, how many connections it currently has, the channel capacity
currently being utilized, etc. SNMP is currently up to version 3 which
is encrypted and requires authentication. This is particularly important
because SNMP is a very powerful protocol which exchanges information
that could potentially be very valuable to an attacker. Access to SNMP
should be limited and its usage on a network should be monitored.

### 4.5. Lab: Scanning with nmap {#_lab_scanning_with_nmap}

::: {.paragraph}
For this lab we will start by downloading and extracting the files
required. Download
[nmap.zip](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/nmap.zip) and
extract it to a directory you can access from the shell. Open a shell in
that directory (it should have a `docker-compose.yml` in it and a
`victim` and `scanner` directory). Since we will be simulating multiple
machines in this lab, we will make use of Docker Compose which was
already installed with Docker. Docker Compose reads a
`docker-compose.yml` file which should already be in your `nmap`
directory. Run `docker-compose up --build --detach` to build and run the
images in the background:

We care about the `eth0` device, so as you can see on my machine the
address is `172.20.0.2`. We will use nmap's ping scan to search for any
device within the last 8 bits of our IP address (`/24`). You may notice
that we are actually on a `/16` subnet, but by limiting ourselves to
`/24` the scan will go *much* faster.

By default, nmap uses a

it does not fully open a connection) and can be run quickly.

nmap is capable of much more than just simple port scanning. nmap
includes version detection and OS fingerprinting (among other things).
To get a much better picture of what exactly `victim` is running, you

::: {.sect2}
### 5.1. Interception Attacks {#_interception_attacks}

::: {.paragraph}
Interception attacks rely on the ability to intercept network
communications. This may be due to the nature of the network being used
or sometimes other methods may leveraged to better position the
attacker. These attacks generally involve forging fictitious messages,
recording transmitted data, or altering the contents of messages while
on a network. This family of attacks places all parts of the CIA triad
at risk.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.1.1. MitM {#_mitm}

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![mitm](images/mitm.svg){width="400" height="144"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A man in the middle attack (MitM) is a blanket term applied when an
attacker is intercepting communication. A typical attack involves
eavesdropping and possibly modifying messages between two parties.
Encryption can be used to mitigate the attack, making it impossible for
an attacker to decrypt the messages they are intercepting. That being
said, particular attention must be paid to the handshaking/key exchange
protocol to be sure that an attacker does not gain access to the key(s)
being used. What follows is an example of MitM being used to intercept
and modify the public key exchange:
:::

::: {.imageblock .text-center}
::: {.content}
![mitm keys](images/mitm-keys.svg){width="500" height="192"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In the above example the MitM allows the first message to pass
unmolested, but tampers with the exchange of the public key. By passing
it's own public key to Bob, the MitM has to ability to decrypt the
messages that Bob sends and can still use Alice's public key to
re-encrypt the messages at pass them to her. You can see how if two
public keys are exchanged in this manner it would be possible to set up
a MitM attack where despite encryption all messages can be seen.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.1.2. MitB {#_mitb}

::: {.paragraph}
MitB stands for man in the browser and is typically caused by a trojan
installing malware that allows the attacker to intercept/modify
communications between the browser and the server. This can be used to
capture data on forms, modify input, or modify the response from the
server. Often the software used in MitB attacks lays dormant until the
victim browses to a targeted website. What follows is an example of how
a MitB attack can be used to modify an online banking request to send
money:
:::

::: {.imageblock .text-center}
::: {.content}
![mitb](images/mitb.svg){width="900" height="242"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
As you can see the attacker ended up with \$10,000 and the victim simply
thought they authorized a payment of \$1,000 to someone else. These
attacks can be difficult to detect because they take place within the
browser and are opportunistic.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.1.3. Replay Attacks {#_replay_attacks}

::: {.paragraph}
This family of attacks typically involves a MitM making a copy of the
transmission and *replaying* it to impersonate the victim. Logon
credentials, simple hashes, and specific commands are sometimes
susceptible to this type of attack. The solution is to use timestamps,
nonces (random number for that particular session), rotating keys, or a
counter to make sure commands cannot be executed outside of context.
:::

::: {.sidebarblock}
::: {.content}
::: {.title}
One-time Passwords
:::

::: {.paragraph}
To help mitigate replay attacks, an online banking application may
require that client use a one-time password (OTP) when submitting
transactions. An OTP is a frequently changing value that is known to
both the client and the server. Several one-time password schemes exist,
most of which make use of a cryptographic hash function with a shared
seed between client and server. Periodically the client and server
update to a new hash based on the seed and without the seed it is
impossible to know what the next hash will be. By using an OTP anyone
who intercepts the traffic will not be able to perform a replay attack
as the password will not be current.

::: {.title}
MitM preventing HTTPS upgrade and skimming passwords
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
If you think about the intercepted key exchange given in the above MitM
example, a similar attack can allow attackers to view SSL traffic. The
attacker gives the victim a bogus certificate authority (CA) certificate
which the victim installs. This is often accomplished via a trojan. Then
the attacker places themselves in the middle of an uninitiated secure
connection. During the key exchange the attacker creates a custom
certificate signed by a bogus CA for the connection between attacker and
victim. The attacker also makes an actual HTTPS connection to the
service and proxies data for the victim. All of the victims data will
show up in plaintext for the attacker but the connection will appear to
be secure for the victim. This is used in the
[Fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler) debugging proxy to decrypt
HTTPS traffic and is also used in some network appliances that perform
deep packet inspection.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Another MitM attack on SSL is simply to maintain or downgrade to an HTTP
connection with the victim and proxy data to an actual HTTPS connection
with the server. Most servers will upgrade an insecure connection, but
by intercepting that exchange the attacker can continue to monitor the
victim's traffic.
:::

### 5.2. Network Layer Attacks {#_network_layer_attacks}

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.2.1. MAC Spoofing/MAC Cloning {#_mac_spoofingmac_cloning}

::: {.paragraph}
Most networks expect that a MAC address will correspond to the unique
numbers on a network interface controller (NIC), but it is actually
quite easy to change. Virtual networking necessitates the ability to use
a different MAC address and this feature is built into most modern
operating systems. MAC spoofing is when an attacker sets their MAC
address to the MAC address of another machine on the network in an
effort to initiate an attack. For example, them may set themselves up as
a gateway to launch a MitM attack.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.2.2. MAC Flooding {#_mac_flooding}

::: {.paragraph}
Switches are tasked with keeping track of which MAC addresses correspond
to which ports on the switch. They use this to make sure that traffic is
only routed where it needs to go. Given that MAC addresses can be
changed, an attacker could flood a switch with packets from many
different MAC addresses and possibly overflow the MAC-port routing
table. Some switches may default to hub-like functionality and send
frames to all ports in an effort to keep traffic flowing. This then
allows an attacker to capture traffic from other machines on the
network.

[ARP Spoofing](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ARP_Spoofing.svg)

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
An attacker may also use ARP packets to impersonate another machine on
the network, such as a gateway router. By repeatedly sending out ARP
packets, *gratuitous arp*, redirecting packets bound for the gateway's
IP to the attackers MAC address an attacker can set up a MitM scenario.
This is particularly difficult because depending on the TTL of the ARP
cache it may take up to 20 minutes for normal network operations to
resume.

### 5.3. Internet Layer Attacks {#_internet_layer_attacks}

#### 5.3.1. IP Spoofing {#_ip_spoofing}

::: {.openblock .float-group}
::: {.content}
::: {.imageblock .left}
::: {.content}
![ip header](images/ip-header.svg){width="500" height="336"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Unfortunately Internet Protocol (IP) was not designed with security in
mind. This means that by default any IP address can be put in the packet
header and the packet will still be forwarded to the network. This leads
to issues where an IP can be *spoofed* and malicious packets sent out.
At this layer there really aren't any good solutions to this problem.
This means that the sources of packets often need to be authenticated in
higher layers and protocols must take into account the fact that the IP
layer is fundamentally insecure.

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The Smurf attack is a great example of how spoofed IP addresses can lead
to major problems. The Smurf attack is an early type of Distributed
Denial of Service attack. An attacker would create an ICMP echo request
with the victims IP address as the source address. This echo request
would be directed at a broadcast IP address for a subnet. Many of the
clients on the subnet would respond the echo request, flooding the
victim with responses. The asymmetric nature of this attack, a single
packet prompting possibly hundreds of responses, made it particularly
hard to deal with. Using a Smurf attack, an attacker could keep a victim
*pinned down* with minimal bandwidth required on their end. Modern
clients no longer respond to ICMP echo requests directed at the
broadcast, mitigating the risk of this kind of attack.

### 5.4. Name Resolution Attacks {#_name_resolution_attacks}

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.4.1. DNS Cache Poisoning {#_dns_cache_poisoning}

::: {.paragraph}
A DNS resolved can be tricked into caching incorrect information and
serving it to other clients. In this scenario an attacker assumes the
role of the authoritative DNS server by responding to a DNS query with a
forged source IP. One of the reasons this is possible is because DNS
query responses are often single, unauthenticated packets. Once the
server has the invalid DNS cache entry it will continue to direct users
to the incorrect IP address for the TTL of the entry.
[DNSSEC](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/dnssec) can be used to
mitigate these attacks by forcing authentication on DNS answers.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.4.2. LLMNR Hijacking {#_llmnr_hijacking}

::: {.paragraph}
In this scenario an attacker responds to a Link-Local Multicast Name
Resolution (LLMNR) broadcast and impersonates an authentication server.
The unexpecting victim fills in their credentials, which are promptly
stolen. This attack can be mitigated by disabling LLMNR on the network.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 5.5. Web-based Attacks {#_web_based_attacks}

::: {.paragraph}
The world wide web and the protocols/formats/languages it uses (HTTP,
HTML, JavaScript, etc.) were *not* originally designed with security in
mind. By default, web pages trust the content they receive to not be
malicious. Scripts, commands, cookies, etc. are implicitly trusted. Web
technologies have become so popular that they are a common target for
attackers and developers must use tokens, sanitize data, and check
inputs if they want those technologies to be secure.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
[The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org/)
is a great source of resources for web application security. They
maintain a top 10 list of web application security risks. As of 2021,
the [OWASP top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) is:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   Broken Access Control

-   Cryptographic Failures

-   Injection

-   Insecure Design

-   Security Misconfiguration

-   Vulnerable and Outdated Components

-   Identification and Authentication Failures

-   Software and Data Integrity Failures

-   Security Logging and Monitoring Failures

-   Server-Side Request Forgery
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.1. XSS {#_xss}

::: {.paragraph}
Cross-Site scripting refers to the process by which a bad actor can
inject a script into a website. Recall that many websites take inputs
from forms and may later display that data on another page. If that data
isn't just data, but actually a JavaScript script, that script may run
on the page that displays it.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Using this technique attackers can access cookies, session tokens, and
other sensitive information. Depending on where the script was injected
and how the server displays that data the script could be stored
permanently on the target server. XSS scripts may also be reflected,
typically sent in links, where they are only used for one session.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
To mitigate XSS risks, it is important that a web developer sanitize
their inputs. When a form is submitted, the website should check that
the data submitted isn't a script or other malicious content. If the
data does cannot be cleaned, it shouldn't be stored or used.

Samy Worm
:::

::: {.paragraph}
One October 4th, 2005 an XSS worm spread across MySpace, the dominant
social network at the time. The worm was written by Samy Kamkar as a
simple post that when read would cause a viewers machine to make their
own post stating \"but most of all, samy is my hero\" and including the
code to propagate. The results was that within 20 hours over one million
users had run the payload.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Now Samy is a prominent security consultant and you can read [his full
technical explanation of the worm
here](https://samy.pl/myspace/tech.html). Vice Motherboard also did a
segment on Samy for their [*Greatest Moments in Hacking History*
series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtnuaHl378M).
:::

:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.2. CSRF {#_csrf}

::: {.paragraph}
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) involves using an victims already
authenticated session in a request that is not part of that session.
Imagine you are logged into Twitter. An attacker sends you a form link
in GMail, that when clicked on posts a tweet that says, \"I'm a CSRF
victim.\" Assuming Twitter accepts the form submission you will now have
a tweet in your timeline that states \"I'm a CSRF victim.\"
:::

::: {.paragraph}
This is probably the most benign scenario, you can imagine things be
much worse with an online banking application. The solution is for the
website (Twitter in this case) to use a CSRF token (which it does). When
the form is generated, a random value is included as a hidden input.
That random, hidden input is the CSRF token. When a submission is made,
if the CSRF token submitted does not match the one created for the form
(which only the valid website knows) the submission is not accepted.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
CSRF tokens are yet another example of how web applications require
proactive security as opposed to being secure by design. Most web apps
are employing them, but it can be easy for a developer to forget.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.3. SSRF {#_ssrf}

::: {.imageblock .text-center}
::: {.content}
![ssrf](images/ssrf.svg){width="880" height="176"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Web systems often communicate with internal servers the retrieve
information. These may be API servers, databases, or messaging servers.
If an attacker can fool a web server into passing a malicious request to
its internal server, the attacker and abuse the internal trust of the
system. This is referred to a server-side request forgery (SSRF). Once
again, this kind of attack is mitigated with input validation, which
needs to be included in the application.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.4. Session Hijacking {#_session_hijacking}

::: {.paragraph}
Session hijacking may involve other methods of compromise, but the end
goal is to \"steal\" a session between the victim and another server.
Imagine the following scenario: A person logs in to their personal
banking website, which issues them a cookie which proves they are
authenticated. A bad actor is monitoring the connections through an XSS
exploit that forwards all connection cookies to them. The bad actor uses
the cookie that was issued to make a transfer from the user's bank
account to the bad actors bank account.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Depending on the method used, session hijacking may be prevented through
use of a better session key or by requiring transport layer security
(TLS) to connect. In the above scenario the only way to prevent session
hijacking would be to repair the initial XSS vulnerability.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.5. SQL Injection {#_sql_injection}

::: {.paragraph}
As mentioned in the SSRF section, almost all web systems are supported
by other servers running internally. One of the most common scenarios is
to have a web server which reaches out to an internal database.
Relational databases utilize structured query language (SQL) so a web
application may generate many different SQL queries during its regular
operations. If a user input is placed directly into the query, it can be
possible to make the result function in a way that was not intended or
yield secret information from the database.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Take a look at the following PHP code:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
$userName = $_POST['user_name']
$pw = $_POST['password']
$statement = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='" + $userName + "' AND password='" + $pw + "';"
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In the case where the user\_name `admin` and the password `password`
were submitted, the following SQL would be generated:
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='password';`
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In the case where the user\_name `admin` and the password `' OR 1=1;`
were submitted, the following SQL would be generated:
`SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='admin' AND password='' OR 1=1;`
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In this second case, a user could login without needing a valid
password.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.6. XML Injection {#_xml_injection}

::: {.paragraph}
XML stands for extensible markup language, and it is often used to
transfer messages. XML can be an important part of a web systems
infrastructure and as such if unsanitized user inputs are allowed to
generate XML the is used in the system many things can go wrong. Using
XML injection an attacker may be able to retrieve secret files or create
admin accounts. XML injection can be mitigated by input validation or
possibly disabling the resolution of external entities in the framework
being used.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.7. LDAP Injection {#_ldap_injection}

::: {.paragraph}
Finally, Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is often used to
store information about users. As such, it can be found behind many web
applications. LDAP also supports complex queries in a similar fashion to
SQL. An unsantized user input can lead to a LDAP query with unexpected
results.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.8. Directory Traversal {#_directory_traversal}

::: {.paragraph}
A poorly designed web server may be subject to a directory traversal
attack. Recall that web servers are designed to serve static content
from a particular directory, `/var/www` for example. Now suppose that an
attacker submitted a `GET` request for
`http://www.example.com/../../etc/shadow`. It is possible that the web
server may actually go up two directories and serve that file.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
This can be addressed with file permissions, access controls, and
filtering incoming requests. It is important to note that there is more
than one way to specify a path in an HTTP request, including using URL
encoding, so all possible malicious inputs must be sanitized.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.9. URL Hijacking/Typosquating {#_url_hijackingtyposquating}

::: {.paragraph}
An unfortunately common, broad-based attack is to buy a domain with a
similar name to a very popular domain. When users mistype the popular
domain they end up at the malicious actor's website. For example,
imagine if someone registered `gooogle.com` (note the three o's). They
could gain a lot of traffic from people who mistyped google.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
These sites could be used for ad revenue, phishing credentials, or even
possibly to distribute malware. A mitigation that several browsers
implement is to keep a list of malicious websites and warn users before
they visit them.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.10. Domain Hijacking {#_domain_hijacking}

::: {.paragraph}
Domain names expire after a certain period of time and the registrant
may forget to renew. In these rare occasions an attacker may actually
gain control of a popular domain name, google.com for example, and route
traffic to their site. The malicious activities are the same as for
typosquating, but the attacker does not need to rely on the users making
a mistake.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
It is also possible to hijack a domain by logging into the domain
registration system using stolen/compromised credentials. In this
scenario an attacker could still modify a record to point to their
server, but wouldn't have to rely on the company forgetting to renew.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.11. Zone Transfer Attacks {#_zone_transfer_attacks}

::: {.paragraph}
On the subject of the domain name system, zone transfer attacks may leak
sensitive information about domains. DNS is a distributed system by
design and is used for resolving domain names into IP addresses. Due to
the distributed nature of the system, protocols were built in for having
a single domain served by multiple servers. These servers pass
information to each other using a DNS zone transfer.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Typically these communications should be internal as they may leak
valuable information regarding the zone. Unfortunately an improperly
configured DNS server may advertise its zone transfers publicly. [In
such a situation an attacker can use the leaked information in the recon
phase of an attack.](https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php)
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.5.12. Clickjacking {#_clickjacking}

::: {.paragraph}
A website may be designed in such a way that the interface is confusing
to the user and they inadvertently click on an advertisement or
malicious link. This is common practice on low integrity websites such
as streaming sites, torrent trackers, and adult websites. It is often
complicated by a poor ad screening or even purposefully making ads that
look similar to the content.

### 5.6. Outcomes {#_outcomes}

::: {.sect3}
#### 5.6.1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) {#_remote_code_execution_rce}

::: {.paragraph}
One of the most dangerous outcomes of an attack is Remote or Arbitrary
Code Execution. RCE gives the attacker the ability to execute any
instructions they want on the compromised machine. Often the attacker
will start a shell with administrative privileges so they can do
whatever they want. Imagine SSHing into a remote Linux machine and
elevating your privileges to root. This is essentially the type of power
that can result from RCE. Attackers may also use the RCE to attack the
availability of a computing resource by causing a program to terminate.
In this situation the RCE is being used as part of a denial of service
(DoS) attack.

[CVE-2021-4034](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-4034),
a local privilege escalation vulnerability recently discovered in the
Linux `pkexec` command. `pkexec` runs with elevated privileges and does
not safely parse command line arguments. As such it can be exploited to
give a regular user a root shell. This would be an example of local,
vertical privilege escalation.

Privilege escalation is typically broken into two categories: horizontal
and vertical. Horizontal privilege escalation gives similar access to
resources, ie. moving from one user account to another. Vertical
privilege escalation gives higher level access, ie. moving from a user
account to an admin account. The five main ways privilege escalation is
achieved are credential exploitation, vulnerabilities/exploits,
misconfigurations, malware, and social engineering.

#### 5.6.3. Denial of Service (DoS) {#_denial_of_service_dos}

::: {.paragraph}
A denial of service attack (Dos) attempts to keep a system from working
by overwhelming it with requests. A distributed denial of service attack
(DDoS) does the same thing by utilizing many different machines.
Typically the attacking nodes for a DDoS attack are members of a botnet,
machines that have been exploited previously and are under the attackers
control.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
DoS attacks can take many forms including:
:::

::: {.dlist}

SYN Floods

:   A malicious actor can send multiple SYN packets to initiate the TCP
    three-way handshake. SYN packets are easy to send, but may cause
    significant resources to be allocated on the server responding to
    them. Due to the asymettric nature of resource allocation this makes
    the use of SYN packets particularly suited to DoS attack. [SYN
    cookies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_cookies) can be used to
    help prevent this kind of attack.

ICMP Floods

:   Often referred to as pinging, ICMP echo requests can be used to
    overwhelm a server. Especially when sent from multiple sources. The
    solution is typically to rate limit ICMP packets on the server.

Buffer Overflows/Exploits

:   Poorly designed software may fail when it receives unexpected data.
    This could be something as simple as sending more data than a buffer
    can hold, or [setting the urgent pointer (URG) on a packet destined
    for port 139 of a Windows
    system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WinNuke).

Remote Shells
:::

::: {.paragraph}
As you have hopefully experienced by completing the labs, Linux systems
traditionally have a powerful shell system that uses text commands to
control the OS. Through the shell you can create, read, update, or
delete files, make network connections, configure kernel parameters,
install packages, etc. In fact, all modern operating systems have shells
that can be used to control them. On a Windows machine, having access to
PowerShell running as an Administrator is all an attacker would need to
have complete control over the system. Often the outcome of an attack is
being able to interact with a shell remotely on the exploited machine.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In this scenario we say the victim is running a *remote shell*. Remote
shells can run in the background on a victim machine listening on a port
for an attacker to connect, but often the exploited machine may not
actually have an external IP the attacker can use to connect. In these
instances a *reverse shell* is used. A reverse shell reaches out from
the victim to the attacker and establishes a connection *from the
inside*. This is more compatible with the firewalls/NAT routers that sit
between most devices and the Internet.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In either case having privileged shell access to a machine over a remote
connection allows an attacker to basically do anything they want. To
that end, many tools have sprung up to provide remote shell access. A
machine may already have a remote shell tool installed, such as an SSH
server. Barring that [Netcat](https://netcat.sourceforge.net/) can be
used with any executable to provide access to it over a network.
[metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/) (a very popular pentesting
framework) comes with many payloads, most of which are shells of various
types. Programs also exist to run shells over ICMP, Discord, IRC, or
even DNS!

### 5.7. Lab: MitM with Scapy {#_lab_mitm_with_scapy}

::: {.paragraph}
In this lab we will use a fake SSH server,
[sshesame](https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame), and an interactive packet
manipulation program, [scapy](https://scapy.net/), to disrupt an ongoing
SSH session between victim and server, position ourself in the middle of
the traffic, and capture the username and password victim is using.

: Table 1. IP Addresses Used

::: {.paragraph}
For this lab our IP addresses are configured statically and are known to
the attacker. It is also assumed that the attacker is on the local
network. Lastly victim has been poorly configured to ignore changes to
the host key. This is not entirely unreasonable as many users just
ignore the warnings and clear out the known\_hosts file when prompted
anyway.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Start by downloading the
[scapy.zip](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/scapy.zip)
file which contains the Docker Compose configuration we will be using.
Uncompress it to a directory where you have write access. This lab will
require us to use three terminal windows/tabs: one for the
`docker-compose up` command which will show the output of everything
running in the background, one for the victim which will show an SSH
session with the server, and one for the attacker which we will use to
make the attack.

  **1**   This is my MAC address of victim, but yours may be different!
  ------- ---------------------------------------------------------------
:::

::: {.paragraph}
This is how an ARP exchange is supposed to work. We broadcast out asking
what MAC we should use for a certain IP and we get a response *from the
person who legitimately has that MAC and IP*.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
We have everything we need to create an ARP packet telling the victim to
send traffic to us when they are trying to access servers IP:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.title}
attacker
:::

::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
>>> victim_ip, victim_mac, server_ip, server_mac

::: {.paragraph}
Now let's make and view an evil ARP packet:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.title}
attacker
:::

::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
>>> bad_arp = ARP(op=2, pdst=victim_ip, psrc=server_ip, hwdst=victim_mac)
>>> bad_arp
<ARP  op=is-at psrc=172.20.0.5 hwdst=02:42:ac:14:00:06 pdst=172.20.0.6 |>
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
This packet posits itself as coming from the server, it is aimed at the
victim in both IP and MAC, but the MAC address that will be used to send
it is ours (by default, we don't specify with `hwsrc`). This means the
victim will update their ARP cache such that frames destined for server
go to attacker. This effectively reroutes all layer 2 traffic that was
going to the server from the victim.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Go ahead an send that ARP packet:
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Now go back to the victim terminal with the SSH connection to server and
try typing something. As soon as SSH has to send data, you will get a
broken pipe error and the connection will drop. Faced with such a
problem, what do you think most users will do? Probably try to
reconnect, let's try that too. Remember the password is \"password\".

6. Security Solutions {#_security_solutions}
---------------------

::: {.sectionbody}
::: {.paragraph}
To help combat security breaches, many different vendors offer security
solutions. These may be hardware or software designed to help mitigate a
security threat. Security solutions may be created in-house, created
custom by a third party, or outsourced and offered as a service. When
evaluating solutions it is important to have a plan and understand the
features and possible pitfalls of that product.
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 6.1. False Positives / Negatives {#_false_positives_negatives}

::: {.paragraph}
When a security solution detects a threat, but no threat exists, that is
a *false positive*. Depending on the complexity of the solution it may
utilize a set of rules, indicators of compromise, or possibly even
artificial intelligence to trigger its warning system. In the case of a
solution that creates a lot of false positives, it can be tiring for a
team to go through each alert. Eventually teams are conditioned to
ignore the alerts, making the security solution useless.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The key to lowering the false positive rate of a system is to better
tune the rule set used to trigger the warnings. A security team may
spend time determining a baseline of events and looking for
abnormalities that correspond to actual attacks. This information can
then be used to build a better detection system.
:::

::: {.exampleblock}
::: {.title}
Example 6. Webroot Antivirus
:::

::: {.content}
::: {.paragraph}
[In 2017 a popular antivirus service created a bad rule that identified
certain Windows operating system files as
threats.](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/popular-antivirus-program-mistakenly-ids-windows-threat-creating-chaos-n750521)
The antivirus solution quarantined these files, which were critical for
the operation of the machine. The result was a machine that was
unusable.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
For 13 minutes, Webroot distributed this rule to its antivirus software
shutting down operations on an untold number of machines. Fortunately
Webroot was able to quickly identify the problem and send out an update
which would have allowed the machines to automatically fix the problem.
Unfortunately their infrastructure for distributing the update quickly
became overloaded.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
When a security solution fails to identify a threat, this is known as a
*false negative*. While no solution can ever be 100% effective, false
negatives can undermine confidence in a product. False negatives may be
resolved by a skilled SOC team, closely monitoring what is happening. It
is also possible to address false negatives through *Layered Security* a
concept that we will cover next.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 6.2. Layered Security {#_layered_security}

::: {.imageblock .left}
::: {.content}
![layers](images/layers.svg){width="328" height="224"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Given that a single security solution is never 100% effective it makes
sense to approach security in layers and use multiple systems. There is
often a lot of overlap between solutions and while that may seem
inefficient in other fields, in cybersecurity we consider it a benefit.
By using multiple solutions, sometimes referred to as multi-layered
security or defense in depth, you can build a more robust protection
against breaches.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Let's take a look at an example to see how layered security can help
mitigate the effects of a real-world attack. Assume an SOC is supporting
a web application on self-hosted machines. A malicious actor wishes to
exfiltrate data from the web application. They begin by testing to see
if SQL several different SQL injection attacks yield any results.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A well designed web application should sanitize its inputs and may
prevent the queries from making it to the database. Similarly an alert
team may notice a sudden uptick in SQL queries, far beyond the usual
baseline for the application. An IDS (Intrusion Detection System) may
flag the queries as known SQL injection attacks. Assuming the attack
makes it past the application, team, and the IDS, it is possible that
the database user is configured according to the principle of least
privilege and the queries will not be executed due to a lack of
permissions.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
As you can see, any one of these layers may be fail, but by having
multiple layers the chance of an attack occurring is greatly diminished.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 6.3. Network Solutions {#_network_solutions}

::: {.paragraph}
Many products are available for handling network traffic. They are
typically marketed as either stand-alone devices, software to install on
internal devices, or a subscription service that routes traffic through
an external appliance. In the age of cloud computing network security as
a service is becoming increasingly popular.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 6.3.1. Firewall {#_firewall}

::: {.paragraph}
A firewall is a service/software/device that blocks unwanted traffic and
permits wanted traffic. Typically a firewall is a barrier between and
private network and the Internet.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Software like
[nftables](https://wiki.nftables.org/wiki-nftables/index.php/Main_Page)
can be used to build a firewall on a Linux router for many interior
clients. Interior clients may also run host-based firewalls such as
[Windows Defender
Firewall](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/windows-firewall/windows-firewall-with-advanced-security).
Finally hardware solutions for plug-in firewall devices are available
from many vendors including Palo Alto and Cisco. Any combination of
these solutions may be used.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Firewalls typically employ rules regarding which packets can come in and
how to handle them. For example a firewall may have a rule to `ALLOW`
packets from exterior hosts connecting on port 22. This would allow SSH
connections. Likewise a firewall may have a rule to track internal to
external connection requests and perform network address translation
(NAT). On an IPv4 network it is common to have a firewall also perform
NAT.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Next-Gen Firewalls (NGFW) perform the same functions of a standard
firewall, but also employ an integrated intrusion prevention system
(IPS) to mitigate threats. The firewall is a perfect place to perform
these actions as it can easily close of connections. NGFW often tout
artificial intelligence threat monitoring and automatic threat
intelligence updating (typically updating attack signatures). A NGFW can
also easily be built on a Linux device by making use of [an
IPS](https://www.snort.org/) in conjunction with a netfilter firewall.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Network infrastructure may also make use of a special space *outside* of
a firewall called the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). Servers that need to be
directly connected to the Internet are often put in the DMZ so they
don't have a deal with restrictive firewall rules. These servers may be
used to detect malicious activity, monitor incoming traffic, or to
handle basic requests such as serving static web pages.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The largest firewall in the world is the Chinese Great Firewall, started
in 1998 as a way to prevent outside influence in China. It is a system
used to block IPs, hijack DNS queries, throttle traffic, and perform
MitM decryption. The Great Firewall is made of proxies and firewalls
performing packet-inspection and content filtering. VPNs are often
employed within China to circumvent the great firewall and the great
firewall is continually updated to attempt to detect and shut down this
traffic.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 6.3.2. Proxy {#_proxy}

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![tls proxy](images/tls-proxy.svg){width="432" height="208"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A proxy typically sits between the users and an external network.
Proxies and receive and send requests on behalf of a user, allowing for
full control over the traffic going out and coming back in.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Proxies can be used for caching, access control, URL filtering, content
scanning, and even packet inspection. Proxy solutions may be explicit or
transparent and are offered by many companies including McAfee,
Fortigate, Netsparker, and Palo Alto. A typical application of a proxy
would be to filter explicit content on a school district network.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Proxies can also be broken into *forward* and *reverse* configurations.
A forward proxy passes requests from a private or internal network to
the internet. Forward proxies can speed up local requests through
caching and validate that the request should be performed. Forward
proxies are interoperable with standard firewalls and network address
translation (NAT).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Reverse proxies take requests from an external source and pass it to an
internal service. This helps prevent clients from having direct access
to internal services. Reverse proxies can utilize caching and validate
requests as well. A reverse proxy can also be configured to work with a
firewall. Whereas it used to be common practice to place a server in a
demilitarized zone (DMZ) outside of a firewall, it is now far more
common to employ a reverse proxy to reach that server.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 6.3.3. Load Balancer {#_load_balancer}

::: {.paragraph}
A common application for reverse proxies is to act as a load balancer
for traffic. Load balancers distribute work, in the form of external
client requests, among the internal resources, typically servers.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
For example, if a company has four servers supporting a web application,
they may employ a reverse proxy load balancer that takes requests from
clients and passes that request to one of the four internal servers.
Different metrics are used to determine how the servers are utilized
including least used (round robin), weighted, least amount of active
connections. Load balancers optimize bandwidth and increase
availability.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 6.3.4. VPN {#_vpn}

::: {.paragraph}
A virtual private network (VPN) is used to encrypt internet traffic
between two networks or a client and a network. VPNs have become
standard procedure for linking remote offices or connecting remote
workers. Given the growth of working from home, almost all users have
become familiar with what a VPN is and what it does.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Site-to-site VPNs are typically used for linking offices together. This
kind of VPN is on permanently. An example would be linking two college
campuses: NJIT Newark and NJIT Jersey City. In this scenario users on
either campus expect to be able to connect securely to services on the
opposite campus at all times. The traffic is encrypted and carried over
the Internet.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Remote access VPNs are used by individuals connecting in to a secure
network. This kind of VPN is usually stated through a application such
as Cisco AnyConnect. When the application is running the user is able to
securely access internal resources as if they were at the office.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Many vendors offer VPN products including Cisco, Citrix, Fortinet, Palo
Alto, and Checkpoint. Many open source options also exist for building
VPNs including [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/),
[WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/), and
[IPsec](https://linuxhint.com/how-to-implement-ipsec-in-linux/).
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 6.3.5. TAP {#_tap}

::: {.paragraph}
Sometimes it is necessary for a network or security engineer to monitor
what is happening on a particular network segment. In this case a
network terminal access point (TAP) can be employed. A TAP creates a
copy of network traffic and forwards it to a particular port on a switch
or router.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 6.4. EDR {#_edr}

::: {.paragraph}
Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) is used to secure endpoints:
servers, workstations, desktops, mobile devices, etc. EDR is typically
implemented as a host-based incident prevention system (HBIPS), software
that runs on the endpoint to monitor and collect data.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
These systems will usually watch for indicators of compromise, scan for
malware, and can even quarantine or shutdown the endpoint as needed.
Company hardware is a significant investment for any business and an EDR
makes sure that investment is protected. Many systems exist for EDR
including FireEye, SEP, and CrowdStrike.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 6.5. Data Loss Prevention {#_data_loss_prevention}

::: {.paragraph}
Data loss prevention (DLP) solutions aim to stop the exfiltration of
sensitive data. This could be personally identifying information (PI),
medical records, social security numbers (SSNs), credit card numbers,
etc. Typically DLP either functions on the endpoint and server, data at
rest, or on the network, data in motion.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Network DLP solutions may monitor emails or web traffic for sensitive
strings, such as SSNs. When an SSN is detecting in an email, the email
is quarantined and an alert is sent. Server and endpoint DLP solutions
may periodically scan the system to see if sensitive strings are stored
on the system. If it is a system that shouldn't have access to sensitive
data an alert is sent. DLP on an endpoint may also limit tasks like USB
usage or bulk data transmitting.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 6.6. IDS/IPS {#_idsips}

::: {.paragraph}
Intrusion Detection Systems and Intrusion Prevention Systems are systems
that monitor network traffic to detect/prevent attacks. These systems
may look for known exploits, such as SQL injection patterns, in the
traffic and trigger an alert when detected. An intrusion *prevention*
system will take it one step further and actually shut down the
connection or kill the offending process.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
These systems employ exploit signatures or IDs that are indicators of
compromise (IoCs), anomalies, or strange behaviors. The power of an
IDS/IPS often comes from how up-to-date it's signature database is.
There are many solutions in the category including Splunk, QRadar,
CrowdStrike, and SolarWinds.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 6.7. Email Solutions {#_email_solutions}

::: {.paragraph}
The original protocols used to send/receive email were simple and not
designed for the challenges we face today. SPAM and phishing emails are
unfortunately common and can be addressed with email client add-ons that
scan for viruses or use patterns to identify phishing emails. Many of
these tools are already built into Google's GMail or Microsofts
Exchange.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Another large challenge is verifying the sender of an email. Currently
three common methods exist: Sender Policy Framework (SPF), DomainKeys
Identified Mail (DKIM), and Domain-base Message Authentication,
Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
SPF utilizes TXT records on a DNS domain to verify the IP of a sender.
When inbound mail is received, the SPF information for the domain of the
sender is retrieved, giving an allowed list of IPs. For example, NJIT's
SPF record currently looks like this:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
v=spf1 ip4:128.235.251.0/24 ip4:128.235.209.0/24 ip4:66.207.100.96/27 ip4:66.207.98.32/27 ip4:205.139.104.0/22 ip4:206.79.6.0/24 ip4:209.235.101.208/28 ip4:216.185.73.96/27 ip4:69.196.241.0/28 ip4:69.196.242.128/28 ip4:46.183.242.192/28 ip4:202.38.144.192/28 ip4:69.196.236.208/28 ip4:103.225.232.128/28 ip4:37.216.222.128/28 ip4:64.125.200.96/28 ip4:74.217.49.0/25 ip4:69.25.227.128/25 ip4:52.45.50.190 ip4:198.187.196.100 include:_netblock.njit.edu include:spf.sparkmail.org ~all
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
It is important to note that not all of these IPs belong to NJIT. Some
may be groups that send emails on NJIT's behalf like mass mailers, web
applications, etc. When properly configured SPF prevents an attacker
from impersonating emails from a domain.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
DKIM utilizes public and private key cryptography to ensure that an
email originated from a particular SMTP server. Public keys for a domain
are advertised through a TXT DNS record for a particular domain. Private
keys are used by the SMTP server for that domain to sign the emails
being sent. A receiving SMTP server can then verify that the message
originated from a valid SMTP server for that domain. Private keys can
also be distributed to SMTP servers that send emails on behalf of the
domain.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
DMARC applies policies to the SPF and DKIM validations. DMARC answers
questions like, \"What should I do if a message is from a valid SPF IP
but doesn't have a valid DKIM signature?\" or \"What should I do with a
message that looks like SPAM but has a valid DKIM signature?\" DMARC
puts many of the tools used to verify email together in a layered
approach to determine whether to pass, quarantine, or block an email.

Security and Information Event management is a system for real-time
monitoring of security information. Typically a SIEM system presents a
dashboard showing events and has the ability to generate reports or
create tickets. It may be separate device, software on an internal
device, or even a third party service. Some examples of popular SIEMs
are QRadar, Splunk, and Azure Sentinel.

### 6.9. Lab: Exploiting log4j {#_lab_exploiting_log4j}

::: {.paragraph}
In this lab we will examine the log4j vulnerability,
[CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228). This
vulnerability takes advantage of a flaw in a common logging library used
by many Java applications, including Apache, neo4j, Steam, iCloud, and
Minecraft. Any attacker that can cause a message to be logged can use
the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) and cause the target to
reach out to another server, LDAP in our example, and load a remote Java
class file. This file can contain any code that the attacker wishes to
inject into the server process.

Our attacker container has [the `pwn.py`
script](https://github.com/leonjza/log4jpwn/blob/master/pwn.py), also by
leonjza, which does two things:
:::

::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  Runs a fake LDAP server in the background on port 8888

2.  Sends a request with the JNDI URI referencing the fake LDAP server
    asking for a Java value to leak

3.  Parses and prints the response
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Using this setup we can show how log4j can be used to leak sensitive
information from running processes. We will use it to leak the value of
the environment variable `DB_PASSWORD`. As it isn't uncommon to store
secrets in environment variables on running containers, this should
suffice to see just how devastating this exploit can be.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Start by downloading [the zip archive of this
lab](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/blob/main/labs/log4j.zip?raw=true)
and unzipping it in a directory where you have write permissions and can
navigate to in a terminal application. Once you've done that, you can
bring the lab up by typing `docker-compose up` in that directory. Output
should look similar to what you see below:

7. Access Controls {#_access_controls}
------------------

::: {.sectionbody}
::: {.paragraph}
Access controls seek to provide tools for *identification*,
*authentication*, *authorization*, and *accounting* with regard to a
particular resource. While individual controls may provide multiple
parts, it is still important to understand what each part represents:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Identification

:   The act of identifying an actor or *something* that is used to
    identify an actor. This could be as simple as a drivers license or
    as complex as a cryptographic signature that can only be made by the
    bearer of a private key. Example: A delivery driver presenting an
    employee badge.

Authentication

:   This step occurs when an identity is confirmed through the use of a
    specific process. This could be the process through which the
    private key is used or perhaps another biometric process such as
    reading a fingerprint. In either case the *authentication* is the
    method by which we verify identity. Example: Examining the delivery
    driver's badge.

Authorization

:   Authorization is when an actor is given permission to access a
    resource. In casual conversation we may assume that *authorization*
    is a foregone conclusion once an actor has progressed this far, but
    in actuality authorization relies on the previous steps being
    completed and may in fact fail. A system may have identified who
    someone was through authentication with a username and password, but
    that user is not set up to have access to a resource. In this case
    the *authorization* step would fail. To continue with our delivery
    driver example: Allowing the delivery driver to pick up a package.

Accounting

:   Finally accounting is the process through which a record of access
    to the resource is recorded. Accounting may be a log of users who
    have signed in an log of what resources they each accessed. In a
    similar vein, with the delivery driver: A record of the driver's
    visit is written in the sign-in book at the front desk.

::: {.sect2}
### 7.1. General Principles and Techniques {#_general_principles_and_techniques}

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.1.1. Least Privilege {#_least_privilege}

::: {.paragraph}
The principle of least privilege states that an actor should only be
given access to resources as necessary and with the permissions
necessary to complete their task. These resources may be processes,
programs, or even user accounts. This principle reduces an attack
surface and helps stop the spread of malware as a single compromised
account will not have access to all of the resources.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Least privilege is also an important concept for compliance purposes.
For example, laws may require and audit of all accounts that have
Internet access. By limiting accounts that have Internet access to only
the accounts of actors that require Internet access to complete their
tasks, it makes it easier to be in compliance.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.1.2. Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) {#_multi_factor_authentication_mfa}

::: {.paragraph}
Multi-factor authentication is a technique that requires actors to
provide two or more pieces of information to be used as identification.
Some examples of identification would be usernames and passwords, token
codes, a physical token, or biometric data. Typically it is suggested to
use \"something you have and something you know\" for example the code
in an SMS message to your phone (you have your phone) and a password
(you know your password).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
There are many popular products for MFA, most of which are based on the
time based creation of a code. [Google
Authenticator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&hl=en_US&gl=US)
and [Authy](https://authy.com/) are each phone applications which
generate codes from a cryptographic seed which is synced with the
verifying system. RSA IDs generate similar codes on a dedicated hardware
device.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.1.3. MAC, DAC, RBAC, and ABAC {#_mac_dac_rbac_and_abac}

::: {.paragraph}
There are several different authorization models that can be used.
Mandatory Access Control (MAC) requires all objects (files, directories,
devices, etc.) to have a security label that identifies who can access
it and how. This is a particularly stringent form of access control
which requires a great deal of effort to implement and maintain, but
results in a high level of security. Discretional Access Control (DAC)
simplifies things by allowing owners of objects to determine which
permissions groups/users should be given to that object. This offers
great flexibility and ease of implementation, but can result in a less
secure environment if the owner of the object is compromised. Role-Based
Access Control (RBAC) builds off of DAC uses a core set of roles within
a system to determine who has different levels of access to objects.
RBAC is a common and flexible model which can be intelligently used to
implement DAC or MAC. Attribute-Based access control (ABAC) is a newer
model that builds off of RBAC and uses more general attributes instead
of just roles. ABAC can determine who has different levels of access to
objects based on the attributes of the object, the user, the action, or
even an external context. These attributes can be used together in any
way that can be codified into a rule. For example, \"Give Fred read
access to non-classified documents in this folder from 9:00AM to
5:00PM.\"

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
An organization's building is a large ongoing investment and is often an
unexpected security asset or weakness. Most technical security controls
can be completely bypassed or disabled if physical security is not taken
into account. As such, steps must be taken to assure that physical
access is limited to protect not only the building and its contents but
also the data that is created and stored there.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.2.1. Gates {#_gates}

::: {.paragraph}
It is easier to manage the physical security of a location when the
amount of entry points are limited. Convenience and safety dictate that
even with such considerations multiple points of ingress are still
needed. A security gate is the most basic tool available the ensure that
only authorized actors gain access.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Security gates can be manned or unmanned and designed to support
vehicular or pedestrian traffic. In general an unmanned security gate is
not going to be as effective as a manned security gate. Likewise,
vehicular gates will be less effective against foot traffic (especially
unmanned vehicular gates) than gates or checkpoints designed for
individuals. A thorough risk assessment is often the first step in
planning where to put gates and what types of gates to use.

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Biometric security devices identify people based on on or more physical
characteristics. This has the great advantage of convenience. A person
may occasionally forget to bring their ID card in to work, but they will
never forget to bring their fingertip or iris! Similarly, since the
items being used for identification are attached to the people that
using them, biometric characteristics are difficult to steal or
impersonate.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Biometric traits are often broken into two categories: physiological and
behavioral. Physiological traits can be facial structure, fingerprints,
palm prints, hand structure, iris patterns, or even the sequence of
someone's DNA. Behavioral traits include voice, signature, and even
keystroke patterns.
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.2.3. Key Cards {#_key_cards}

::: {.paragraph}
Many security measures employ key cards for access to rooms. A key card
uses the same form factor as a credit card, making it easy for employees
to carry in their wallets or ID holders. Key cards may utilize magnetic
stripes or chips (in a similar fashion to credit cards), radio frequency
identification (RFID), or near field communication (NFC).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Basic passive keycards are often subject to skimming and cloning
attacks. Once an attacker can gain access to the unique number stored on
the card, they can recreate the card. It is important to monitor areas
where key cards are being used to make sure additional hardware is not
installed by an attacker to read these numbers. It is also important to
educate users of the system so they do not share their key cards with
others and report them if they go missing.

Proximity Cards
:::

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![rfid](images/rfid.svg){width="336" height="368"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The most ubiquitous RFID card, the proximity or prox card, is vulnerable
to a very basic cloning attack. The keycard is a *passive* electronic
device, meaning it utilizes a coil as both an antenna *and* a source of
power for its circuit. This has the advantage of not requiring a battery
only working when the card is placed in an electromagnetic field, like
near the reader on a door with an RFID reader. The RFID reader will
generate a 125 kHz radio frequency field. The prox card has a long
antenna which spirals around the outside. This antenna is designed to be
resonant at 125 kHz and when powered by the field created by the reader
it charges a capacitor and provides current to an IC. The IC then
broadcasts the card's ID.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Unfortunately this passive configuration limits the circuitry to very
simple operations due to the need for low power consumption. All a
proximity card can do when activated is broadcast the card's ID. An
attacker can listen for that number by placing another reader next to
the legitimate reader or even carrying a portable reader that will
activate the card when close to the user. Once the attacker has the 26
bit unique number of the card, they can make their own card with that
same number and gain access.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
There have been proposals for strengthen RFID systems [including using
AES](https://www.iacr.org/archive/ches2004/31560357/31560357.pdf). It is
also possible to require another factor of identification in addition to
the keycard. Fortunately, many systems seem to be moving to phone
applications via NFC which have significantly more processing power to
support trustless cryptographic identification.
:::

:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.2.4. Security Guards {#_security_guards}

::: {.paragraph}
The most versatile assets in any organization are human assets and the
same is true of security guards. Security guards can be used to verify
IDs, enforce rules, stopped forced entry, and take actions as necessary.
Given the expensive nature of human resources, security guards should be
employed in critical locations where risk is high. They may also benefit
greatly from staff awareness training even if their job description may
be different from the other employees you are training.

:::

::: {.paragraph}
Cameras afford the operator an \"always on\" view of a location.
Awareness that all activity is being recorded can persuade attackers to
aim for an easier target or not continue with their nefarious actions.
Even if an attacker persists the camera footage can provide proof of the
attack as well as evidence that can be used later to track the attacker
or make better security decisions.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The \"eye in the sky\" seems to have the effect of keeping honest people
honest, but is often just seen as an obstacle for those intent on
breaking the rules. Despite this cameras do have several technological
advantages. They can work in no/low light conditions, can be remotely
controlled and monitored, can store footage remotely, can track motion,
and can activate/alert on motion events. Cameras are an integral part of
most security plans.

CCTV in London
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The largest deployment of CCTV cameras in the world is currently in
London England. [There are over half a million cameras recording the
average Londoner more than 300 times a
day.](https://www.caughtoncamera.net/news/how-many-cctv-cameras-in-london/)
This makes London a very interesting case study in the effects of
widespread camera use.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
It appears that conspicuous cameras can prevent certain types of crime
(theft and burglary) but have little effect on crimes of passion
(spontaneous and unplanned crimes). In aggregate, cameras appear to not
have an effect on the overall amount of crime. While decreases have
occasionally been seen, causation cannot be established.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
From a security perspective, we are not only concerned with preventing
crimes, but also concerned with tightening our security after a breach
has occurred. The cameras in London have been shown to aid in *solving*
crimes after they have occurred. This bodes well in a security context
where that is a major goal.

::: {.paragraph}
A mantrap is a physical access control that requires one person at a
time enter through a door. Also known as air locks, sally ports, or
access control vestibules, mantraps are used to prevent tailgating, or
following another person through a secured door. These devices are often
used with keycards to ensure that only people who are supposed to have
access to a building can get in.

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.1. Active Directory {#_active_directory}

::: {.paragraph}
Active Directory (AD) is a directory service typically used in Windows
networks to control and track resources. AD is a Microsoft technology
that enables centralized network management. It has proven to be very
scalable and is commonly deployed in the enterprise environment
(corporations, universities, schools, etc.)
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Active Directory relies upon the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol
(LDAP) for its communications. While AD is probably the largest deployed
user of LDAP other implementations for various operating systems exist,
including Apple OpenDirectory, RH Directory Server, and OpenLDAP. LDAP
is often used by internal applications and process.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The cornerstone of an AD environment is the Domain Controller (DC). DCs
stores directory information about Users, Groups, Computers, Policies,
and more. They respond to auth requests for the domain (network) they
are supporting. A standard network will have multiple DCs with fail-over
in place in case something goes wrong.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
For many environments, AD is the mechanism used for authentication,
authorization, and accounting. As many services have migrated to the
web, the need to access AD from anywhere has become increasingly
important. This has kindled the growth of Azure Active Directory, a
cloud-based version of active directory. Increasingly we are seeing
deployments that utilize cloud-based resources instead of local DCs.

#### 7.3.2. Privileged Identity Management (PIM) {#_privileged_identity_management_pim}

::: {.paragraph}
Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a method of managing access to
resources such as locations, commands, audit reports, and services. PIM
aims to provide more granular access control. By recording more
information about access it allows for better reporting regarding
suspicious behavior and anomalies. PIM is used in the Windows operating
system and for many Microsoft Azure services.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.3. Privileged Access Management (PAM) {#_privileged_access_management_pam}

::: {.paragraph}
Privileged Access Management (PAM) is a framework for safeguarding
identities with advanced capabilities, such as superusers in a \*NIX
system. PAM is common in the Linux world, where it is used to control
how administrators log in. PAM supports many more features than the
older \"become root and perform admin tasks\" model. With PAM passwords
can be set to expire, better auditing can be put in place, and privilege
escalation can be made temporary.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.4. Identity and Access Management (IAM) {#_identity_and_access_management_iam}

::: {.paragraph}
Identity and Access Management is a framework for managing digital
identities. IAM manages the user database, logs when users sign in and
out, manages the creation of groups or roles, and allows for the
assignment and removal of access privileges. Many different groups offer
IAM frameworks, the most famous of which may be Amazon Web Systems (AWS)
which use it for controlling access to the infrastructure as a service
(IaaS) technologies they offer.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
IAM often makes use of PIM and PAM to accomplish these goals. A
well-implemented, thorough IAM framework can work across operating
systems and handle many different types of resources.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.5. Unix File Permissions {#_unix_file_permissions}

::: {.paragraph}
From its inception, Unix was designed to be a multi-user environment,
and as such, a lot of attention was paid to file permissions. Every file
in a Unix system has an owner and a group. Each file also has
permissions for owner, group, and all users. Permissions are set using
octal numbers where each bit represents read (bit 0: 1), write (bit 1:
2), or execute (bit 2: 4) permission.
:::

::: {.imageblock .left}
::: {.content}
![permissions](images/permissions.svg){width="336" height="144"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
For example, if you wanted a read and execute permission the number
would be 5 (1 + 4). Read and write permission would be 3 (1 + 2).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Permissions are specified with the `chmod` command, the first octal
number is the permissions for the owner, the second is for the group,
and the third is for all user. So to change a file to have read, write,
and execute permissions for the owner, read permissions for the group,
and no permissions for everyone else, the command would be
`chmod 710 <filename>` where `<filename>` is the name of your file.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The owner and group of a file can be set with the `chown` command:
`chown <owner>.<group> <filename>`. If `<group>` is not specified only
the owner is changed.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.6. ACLs {#_acls}

::: {.paragraph}
Access Control Lists (ACL) are used to permit or deny access based on a
characteristic. They tend to be based on a simple characteristic and
either deny access to anyone not on the list, *allowlist*, or deny
access to anyone who *is* on the list, *denylist*.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
ACLs used in networking and typically filter based on IP address. You
can find examples of ACLs in most firewall products as well as in Amazon
Web Services (AWS) Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Filesystem ACLs apply the same concept to files. Linux uses fileystem
ACLs to permit or deny access in a more nuanced way than possible with
[Unix File Permissions](index.html#_unix_file_permissions).
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.7. SSH Keys {#_ssh_keys}

::: {.paragraph}
Secure Shell Server (SSH) supports the use of asymmetric encryption keys
for authentication. Most severs support RSA, DSA, and ECDSA keys, with
RSA being the most common. An SSH server maintains a list of authorized
keys, typically in `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, that can be used to connect
to the server. When a client connects, the SSH server issues a challenge
asking the client to sign a random piece of data using their private
key. If the private key matches the public key stored in the
`authorized_keys` file, the user is logged in.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
SSH keys have the advantage of being easier to use as the user doesn't
need to remember and type in a password. For this reason, keys are often
used for authentication when running protocols over SSH such a
[git](https://git-scm.com/). Keys also have the advantage of possibly
thwarting MitM attacks. While a password can be easily stolen by a
malicious actor impersonating an SSH server, authentication via key will
only transmit a signed bit of random data. This bit of data is useless
to the MitM.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.8. Sessions and Cookies {#_sessions_and_cookies}

::: {.paragraph}
HTTP sessions can also be used to control access to a resource. This is
often employed in web applications. Upon successful sign-in, a user is
given a cookie with a cryptographically tamper-resistant session ID.
Every request the user makes to that site will include that cookie.
Eventually the session will time out and the user will make a request
that is denied based on their session ID no longer being valid.
Typically the website will redirect them from the protected resource to
a login page where they can log in again.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Website cookies may also be used to store user preferences or the
current state of the application. A cookie could list the items
currently in a users shopping cart or specify whether or not the user
prefers dark mode. Cookies have been a target of scrutiny as they can be
used in attacks. If cookies can be accessed by an outside application or
by a separate malicious tab in a web browser, then can be used to gain
access to a users session.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.9. Single Sign On (SSO) {#_single_sign_on_sso}

::: {.paragraph}
Given the ubiquitous nature of web applications, maintaining separate
usernames and passwords can be difficult for users. A recent trend has
been to support Single Sign On, where one identity provider is used to
confirm that users are who they claim to be. There are a few protocols
that make this possible, including SAML and OAuth.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
SAML stands for Security Assertion Markup Language and is an XML based
Single Sign On solution. The SAML workflow centers around the SAML
identity provider or IDP. The following steps take place to grant access
to a resource via SAML:
:::

::: {.olist .arabic}
1.  User accesses a sevice

2.  User is redirected to SAML IDP with SAML request

3.  User logs in

4.  Credentials are verified

5.  SAML IDP sends credentials to the service
:::

::: {.paragraph}
OpenID is another protocol that allows users to authenticated using a
third-party identity provider in a similar fashion to SAML. One of the
main differences is that OpenID was designed to be decentralized,
allowing for multiple IDPs for users to choose from. In February 2014
OpenID introduced OpenID Connect (OIDC), a more modern system that
allows IDPs to provide information about users via a REST API. This move
was largely in response to the popularity of OAuth.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
OAuth is a method for allowing websites to access parts of a user's
profile with the user's permission. OAuth is not *technically* a
full-fledged authentication protocol, but it is often used as part of
one. The following diagram highlights the differences between OpenID
authentication and an OAuth flow:

#### 7.3.10. Kerberos {#_kerberos}

::: {.paragraph}
Kerberos is an authentication protocol for client server connections. It
was developed by MIT in the 1980s and is most largely deployed on
Windows networks, but many Linux distributions support using it for
authentication as well. Kerberos makes extensive use of time-based
tickets and as such all client participating must have their clocks in
sync. When functioning correctly, Kerberos allows for full
authentication on an untrusted network.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Kerberos makes use of many different services and concepts to perform
its duties. Some of these services may run on the same machine and they
are almost always abbreviated:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Authentication Server (AS)

:   performs the authentication step with clients

Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)

:   service which creates and signs tickets

Ticket-Granting Tickets (TGT)

:   time stamped and encrypted (with the TGS secret key) ticket that
    grants the ability to create tickets and sessions for services

Key Distribution Center (KDC)

:   runs the TGS and grants TGTs

Service Principle Name (SPN)

:   name of a service that uses Kerberos authentication
:::

::: {.paragraph}
To sign in and client reaches out to the AS which gets a TGT from the
TGS running on the KDC and gives it to the client. The client gets the
SPN of the service it wants to utilize and sends it along with the TGT
to the TGS. Assuming the client has permission to access the service the
TGS issues a ticket and session to the client. The ticket is then used
to connect to the service.
:::

::: {.sidebarblock}
::: {.content}
::: {.title}
Golden Ticket
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A dangerous attack against Kerberos authentication exists and goes by
the name *Golden Ticket*. TGTs are the cornerstone of Kerberos security
and the Golden Ticket exploit targets them specifically.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Using the fully qualified domain name, security identifier, username of
an account, and a KRBTGT password hash an attacker can create their own
TGTs that will grant access to services. The KRBTGT account is an
account that Windows machines use to perform Kerberos administrative
tasks. The KRBTGT password hash can be obtained from any machine where
that account was used if the attacker has complete access to the files
on the hard drive. This may be done with physical access or through the
use of malware on a victim machine.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
An attacker will only be able to forge TGTs until the KRBTGT account
password is changed, [so a common remediation strategy is to change the
password](https://blog.quest.com/what-is-krbtgt-and-why-should-you-change-the-password/).
Ultimately the administrator will need to determine how the KRBTGT
password hash was obtained in the first place.
:::
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 7.3.11. Tokenization {#_tokenization}

::: {.paragraph}
Tokenization may be used as part of an access control scheme to protect
sensitive information. Information that would be highly valuable if
compromised is replaced with a random token known to the parties
involved in the transaction. In a typically scenario once the tokens
have been established, only the token is sent out over an untrusted
network.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Imagine you don't want your credit card number exposed to merchants. One
solution would be if you used a payment service that issued you a new
credit card number for each transaction. This credit card number would
only be valid for a single transaction and would be billed to your
regular credit card (which the payment service would have access to). In
this case the token is the one-time-use credit card number and the
sensitive information is your actual credit card number. Payment
services like ApplePay and GoogleWallet do exactly this.

### 7.4. Lab: Linux File Permissions {#_lab_linux_file_permissions}

::: {.paragraph}
In this lab we are going to explore UNIX style file permissions and
determine what they can do and why they are limited. Finally we will see
how Linux ACLs provide more flexibility in assigning permissions.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
We will be working in a vanilla Ubuntu container and installing software
and adding users manually. Let's start up the container, install the
packages we need, and add some users to work with:
:::

root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# useradd bob
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# useradd carol
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# useradd dave
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Traditional UNIX file permissions support user and group ownership of a
file. Read, write, and execute permissions for a file can be set for the
user, group, or others. You can view the permissions of a file with the
`ls -l` command. Let's make home directories for Alice, Bob, and Carol
and view the default permissions:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/# cd home
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# mkdir alice bob carol
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The text `drwxr-xr-x` tells us that these files are directories, the
owner has read/write/execute permission, the group has read/execute
permission, and other users have read/execute permission. It is
important to note that execute permissions are required for viewing the
contents of a directory.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Files owners and a groups are set with the `chown` command, following
the format `chown <user>.<group> <filename>`. Let's try to use this
command to make the home directories of alice, bob, and carol private:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown alice.alice alice
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown bob.bob bob
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chown carol.carol carol
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l
total 12
drwxr-xr-x 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice
drwxr-xr-x 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob
drwxr-xr-x 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
When a user is added to a UNIX system with the `useradd` command a group
with their name is created. This allows us to pass a group to `chown`
that only they will have access to. While this is a good start, others
still have the ability to read and execute these directories, meaning
*anyone* can view the contents. To prove this, lets assume the role of
dave and try doing an `ls` on each of the directories:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave (1)
$ ls alice
$ ls bob
$ ls carol
$ exit
```
:::
:::

::: {.colist .arabic}
  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **1**   `su` allows us to assume the role of anyone, often it is used to assume the role of the *superuser*
  ------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The `ls` command was successful even though there were no files to look
at. If we weren't able to view the contents, we would have received a
permission denied error. The `chmod` command is used to modify file
permissions for a User (`u`), Group (`g`), Others (`o`), or All (`a`).
`chmod` can remove a permission with `-`, add a permission with `+`, or
set a permission (removing others) with `=`. Let's use `chmod` to
actually make these home directories private:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= alice
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= bob
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# chmod u=rwx,g=,o= carol
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# ls -l
total 12
drwx------ 2 alice alice 4096 Oct 28 01:28 alice
drwx------ 2 bob   bob   4096 Oct 28 01:28 bob
drwx------ 2 carol carol 4096 Oct 28 01:28 carol
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Things look much better, but let's test it and see if Dave can view any
of the directories:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su dave
$ ls alice
ls: cannot open directory 'alice': Permission denied
$ ls bob
ls: cannot open directory 'bob': Permission denied
$ ls carol
ls: cannot open directory 'carol': Permission denied
$ exit
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Lastly, lets make sure that Alice can view the contents of her home
directory:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
root@11ce9e5ee80e:/home# su alice
$ ls alice
$ exit
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Looks good!

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Unfortunately traditional UNIX file permissions often do not provide the
granularity needed in a modern system. For example, lets assume that we
wanted a web server to be able to view the contents of Alice, Bob, and
Carol's home directories. This is typically done to allow users to place
a `public_html` directory in their home directory and set up a personal
web space. We could do this by making their home directories viewable by
others, but then we have the same issue we started with. We could also
do this by changing the group ownership of their home directories to a
group that the web server is part of, but then we open up the home
directories to any other users or services that are part of that group.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The solution to this problem is to use Linux ACLs, which allow you to
fine tune permissions. Two commands, `setfacl` and `getfacl` are used to
adjust Linux ACLs. As an example let's add an http user, use the
`setfacl` command to explicitly give the http user read and execute
permissions to all three directories, list the new permissions, and list
the new ACLs:
:::

::: {.listingblock}

8. Vulnerability Management and Compliance {#_vulnerability_management_and_compliance}
------------------------------------------

::: {.sectionbody}
::: {.paragraph}
It is not only good practice, but also a matter of law that information
infrastructure be secured. In order to better understand what that
legalities are and how vulnerabilities can and should be addressed, we
need to make sure we understand the key terms used:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Vulnerability

:   a weakness or lack of countermeasure that can be exploited by a
    threat

Vulnerability Management

:   the process of identifying, classifying, and remediating
    vulnerabilities

Asset

:   something that we are trying to protect

Threat

:   the vulnerability being exploited

Risk

:   the impact of an exploit taking place

Control/Countermeasure

:   actions taken/configurations to remediate vulnerabilities
:::

::: {.paragraph}
It may be helpful to discuss these in terms of an analogy. A
vulnerability would be an unlocked door. Vulnerability management would
be noticing the door and weighing the risk. This may involve looking at
the crime rate of the area, determining the value of the items in the
house, taking into account how difficult it would be to lock the door,
and determining whether you want to lock the door and/or purchase an
alarm system. An asset would be the things in the house, like a laptop
of example. Risk would be the impact or a robbery, perhaps \$800 for the
lost laptop. Finally controls/countermeasures would be locking the door,
getting a camera system, and/or and alarm system.

### 8.1. Vulnerability Management {#_vulnerability_management}

::: {.paragraph}
The first step in managing vulnerabilities is gathering information. The
security team needs to collect:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   Hardware information including the operating systems being used and
    type of device (laptop, server, IoT, etc.)

-   Network information including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and
    details about the network segment

-   Domain information including domain name and workgroup

-   Information about applications used and their approval status

-   Information from security tools currently running on the device

-   Owner information for the device
:::

::: {.paragraph}
This information can be gathered from endpoint management software and a
significant portion of it typically is. This step is part of inventory
management, the process of keeping a centralized database of asset
information. Using endpoint agents, network monitoring (often via simple
network management protocol, SNMP), and endpoint scripts, an inventory
management system can keep track of the last date a user was logged in,
the operating system being used, the applications installed and their
install dates, and the network segment the device is on. Good inventory
management is required for good vulnerability management.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Scans can also be used to find vulnerabilities. Vulnerability scans can
be run internally and externally either under a privileged or
unprivileged account. Scans are typically scheduled and run per network
segment at times when they will be least intrusive. These scans will
generate reports or use dashboards to keep the security team notified if
any vulnerabilities are found.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Scripts or third party programs can also be used to monitor specific
endpoints. These scripts may perform ICMP, SNMP, TCP/UDP, or HTTP
checks. Often they are specific to the device being monitor. For
example, if we have an internal web server that has had a directory
traversal vulnerability in the past we might write a script to perform
GET requests for vulnerable URLS and return an alert if they succeed.
This kind of bespoke monitoring is a key aspect of vulnerability
management.

#### 8.1.1. CVEs {#_cves}

::: {.imageblock .left}
::: {.content}
![cve](images/cve.svg){width="400"}
:::

::: {.title}
[CVE Logo](https://www.cve.org/) is used under fair use
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Vulnerabilities are classified/published in a US national vulnerability
database operated by the MITRE corporation. The database is known as
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures or CVE for short. Typically these
vulnerabilities are reported by vendors or researchers, vetted by MITRE,
and finally given a number. A typical CVE may look like this:
CVE-2021-26740. This shows the year the vulnerability was disclosed as
well as a unique number for that vulnerability in that year.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Security scanners will often report CVEs on systems that are vulnerable.
The security team can then look up the CVE and find what steps can be
taken to mitigate the exploit. It's important to note that MITRE and the
disclosing vendor may also choose to [*embargo* a
CVE](https://lwn.net/Articles/762512/), that is delay its release until
after a patch is available. This does mean that not *all* disclosed
vulnerabilities are immediately available in the CVE database.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.1.2. CVSS {#_cvss}

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![cvss](images/cvss.svg){width="152" height="160"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The Common Vulnerability Scoring System is a system used to assess the
severity of exploits and vulnerabilities. Once a CVE is created a CVSS
is also creating, taking into account the prevalence of the exploit, its
ease of use, and its ability to do harm. CVSSs use a scale of zero to
ten, zero being the least severe and ten being the most severe:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   0.0: None

-   0.1-3.9: Low

-   4.0-6.9: Medium

-   7.0-8.9: High

-   9.0-10.0: Critical
:::

::: {.paragraph}
CVSSs are researched and maintained by the National Infrastructure
Advisory Council (NIAC). A CVSS score is a very important tool used in
the next phase we will discuss, evaluation.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.1.3. Evaluation {#_evaluation}

::: {.paragraph}
Once information has been gathered and the threats are understood it is
time to perform an evaluation.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A security team needs to take into account the costs of asset. If this
device was to go down how damaging would that be to the company? If it
needed to be replaced how much would it cost?
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The value of the data also needs to be assessed. Is that data sensitive?
Is it mission critical to the functioning of the company? What would
happen if we lost this data?
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The value of an asset or data to a bad actor also needs to be assessed.
Is there sensitive data that could be sold? Could the leaked data
compromise the companies long-term goals? Could the data be used to
cause an outage?
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Legal consequences of a vulnerability should also be assessed. Will
there be fines or lawsuits if this vulnerability is exploited?
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Finally reputational consequences should be evaluated. Will there be a
loss of customers if this threat is realized? Will a breach undermine
the trust people place in us?
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 8.2. Compliance {#_compliance}

::: {.paragraph}
Both business and legal standards have been established to ensure that
all parts of the information security CIA triad are protected. Taking
measures to follow these standards is known as *compliance*. This
section will outline the details of many important policies and
businesses comply with.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.2.1. Compliance Tools {#_compliance_tools}

::: {.paragraph}
In order to determine if systems are in compliance, compliance audits
are performed. These may be automated, and may be as simple as endpoint
software that periodically scans machines. They may be as complex as
having an outside team perform penetration testing on a particular site.
In either case, compliance audits are looking for situations that
violate security policies.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
*Risk assessment* is an important part of compliance that determines
just how damaging one of the violations discovered may be. Risk analysis
reports are often generated as a second step in a compliance audit.
These reports help the company make an informed decision as to what
actions should be taken.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Lastly *change controls* are used to ensure that changes that need to
happen are put in place and to track down changes that led to the
violations of the security policies. By keeping track of how and why a
system changes and requiring approvals systems can more from an insecure
state to a secure one and hopefully stay that way. Change controls
should be found in all facets of cybersecurity work.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.2.2. PII/PCI {#_piipci}

::: {.paragraph}
Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Payment Card Industry
(PCI) compliance is probably the largest sector of compliance. PII may
be social security numbers (SSNs), first and last names, birthdays,
addresses, mother's maiden names, etc. PCI related data would be a card
holder's name, account number, card expiration dates, security codes,
strip/chip data, PINs, or card numbers.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Most of the protocols detailed here are designed to protect this data.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.2.3. PCI DSS {#_pci_dss}

::: {.paragraph}
PCI DSS stands for Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards. It is
mandated by the major credit card companies and maintained by the
Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Coming in at over 100 pages, the DSS are basic rules to protect PCI
data. They detail network security, vulnerability management,
monitoring/testing requirements, and other information security policy.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The standards are are based on levels, which in turn are based on how
many credit card transactions a business performs. More strict standards
are applied to companies that do more business (lower levels). The
levels are shown below:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   Level 1 - Over six million transactions annually

-   Level 2 - Between one and six million transactions annually

-   Level 3 - Between 20,000 and one million transactions annually

-   Level 4 - Less than 20,000 transactions annually
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.2.4. PHI/HIPPA {#_phihippa}

::: {.paragraph}
Protected Health Information (PHI) is another type of protected data
covered by various legal and industry standards. PHI may be a medical
history, admissions information for medical facilities, prescription
information, or health insurance data.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) provides
standards for how PHI should be handled. In accordance with HIPAA PHI
can only be disclosed to certain parties, users have a right to see and
correct PHI, and PHI must be securely stored and transmitted.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
If you've ever wondered why your health care provider always sends you
to a secure portal instead of emailing you the details of your visit, it
is because they are dealing with PHI and email is not considered secure.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.2.5. SOX/GLBA {#_soxglba}

::: {.paragraph}
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) was passed following the busting of the
dotcom bubble to help combat financial fraud. SOX details some basic CIA
measures (as do most regulations):
:::

::: {.dlist}

Confidentiality

:   encryption, data loss prevention

Integrity

:   access control, logging

Accessibility

:   data retention, audits, public disclosure of breaches
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The interesting thing is that these controls also make it harder for a
company to lie about its dealings. By retaining records for 90 days,
tracking changes, and requiring public disclosure, SOX makes it harder
for corporations to commit fraud.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The Gram-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) is another act designed to protect CIA
and provide more information for the customer. The GLBA mandates that a
financial institution must explain what they do with customer
information, offer the customer the right to opt-out, and make sure the
vendors they work with are in compliance.

::: {.title}
[Convert GDPR](https://www.Convert.com/GDPR) is used under [CC BY
2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/)
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a less targeted, but
more far-reaching European Union law requiring that customers be
notified if they are being tracked. For most people, the biggest effect
of the GDPR is that they have to sign off on cookies being used by web
sites. Recall that cookies are used almost exclusively for session
management and as such they track visitors to a website.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The GDPR outlines rules for risk assessment, encryption, pseudonym
usage, documentation, and audits. The GDPR also gives visitors the
option to have their customer data forgotten by a website. Businesses
wishing to operation in the European theater, most world-wide
businesses, must make themselves GDPR compliant.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 8.2.7. US Patriot Act/PRISM {#_us_patriot_actprism}

::: {.paragraph}
Not all regulations that require compliance are concerned with
protecting information. Some regulations are designed to specifically
weaken confidentiality for spying by government entities.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The US Patriot Act was passed following the 9/11 attacks and among many
other things, it required telecom providers to comply with request
customer information. These could be logs of phone calls, samples of
network traffic, or location information.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Later in 2007, the Protect America Act (PAA) expanded on this
surveillance requiring more companies to comply with requests for
information. This act ushered in the PRISM program, uncovered by the
Edward Snowden leaks, which forced companies to comply with a world-wide
internet surveillance program.

### 8.3. Lab: Scanning with Nessus {#_lab_scanning_with_nessus}

::: {.paragraph}
In this lab we will be downloading the Nessus vulnerability scanner and
using it to scan a machine. [Click here to register for an activation
code and receive a link to download Nessus

Once you have installed the latest version of Nessus for your OS and
completed the registration move on to the next steps.
:::

::: {.admonitionblock .warning}
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Nessus runs a web interface on localhost with a self-signed certificate, so you will need to accept it to continue.
  -- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Run `ipconfig` on a Windows device or `ifconfig` on a Mac to find your
Wifi adapter IP address. Exchange IP addresses with a friend (you will
scan each other) and put your friend's IP into the *Welcome to Nessus
Essentials* dialog. When you click *Next* Nessus will begin the host
discovery step, making sure that the IP address you put in actually
corresponds to an active host. Click the checkbox next to the host once
it shows up in *Host Discovery* and run the scan. You'll notice the
status is *Running* while the scan is being performed.

9. Incident Response and Continuity {#_incident_response_and_continuity}
-----------------------------------

::: {.sectionbody}
::: {.paragraph}
Even with the strongest security controls in place, incidents will still
occur. It is important to be prepared to respond and get things back up
and running as soon as possible. This process is known as incident
response and continuity.
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 9.1. Security Organizations {#_security_organizations}

::: {.paragraph}
We have looked at many of these security ogranizations already, but we
talk about them in more depth here. These organizations create the
analysis frameworks and vulnerability lists that security specialists
use to respond to an incident.
:::

:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
In the 1940s and 1950s MIT scientists developed large-scale computing
laboratories. In 1958 MITRE was formed as a private corporation from the
personnel and equipment in these labs. Currently, MITRE is a federally
funded research and development center.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
As mentioned previously, MITRE maintains the CVE DB. MITRE has also
developed the ATT&CK framework for analyzing incidents. We will go
through each step of the framework at the end of this chapter.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.1.2. NIST {#_nist}

::: {.paragraph}
NIST stands for National Institute of Standards and Technology. It is a
federally supported through the US Department of Commerce and posits
itself as an institute to promote American innovation. NIST develops
standards, guidelines, and best practices in technical fields.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
NIST also has a security framework they've developed known as the NIST
framework. It outlines the general responsibilities of a security team:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   Identify

-   Protect

-   Detect

-   Respond

-   Recover
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.1.3. OWASP {#_owasp}

::: {.paragraph}
The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is an international
non-profit organization focused on web application security. They have
an active online community with tools, forums, videos, and news posts.
Their most popular resource is the [OWASP Top
10](https://owasp.org/Top10), an annual listing of the most popular web
application vulnerabilities.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 9.2. SOC {#_soc}

::: {.paragraph}
A security operations center (SOC) is a dedicated team of security
experts working within the business they are protecting. Incident
response and recovery is the job of the SOC. SOCs also set up
preventative infrastructure, monitor the environment, respond to
possible threats, manage logs, and maintain compliance.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
An important concept in the SOC is the idea of a *baseline*. A popular
company may be attacked hundreds of times over the course of a day. It
is important that the SOC knows what the average volume of attack is so
they can maintain resources to respond. Through monitoring an SOC can
establish a baseline of what is normal in the environment.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 9.3. Incidents {#_incidents}

::: {.paragraph}
Incidents are part of working at an SOC, they will occur. The best SOCs
may spot them before they're an issue (or an incident even) and have
practice how to respond and recovery. The goal is to maintain continuity
of services provided even if an incident occurs.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.3.1. Precursors {#_precursors}

::: {.paragraph}
Typically before an incident takes place, there are warning signs or
precursors telling you that an incident is going to occur. Precursors
may be obvious like threats from APTs, criminal organizations, or
Hacktivist. They can also be subtle, such as patterns of recon in web
server logs or evidence of transient port scans. Finally a precursor may
be the discovery of a new exploit which leads to an uptick in malicious
actor activity for everyone. In all cases, it's important to keep an eye
out for precursors. If an incident is caught in this phase it is much
easier to handle.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.3.2. Indicators {#_indicators}

::: {.paragraph}
The next level up from a precursor is an indicator. An indicator is an
alert showing that an incident has been detected. These may be raised by
the IDS/IPS, endpoint management system, malware scanners, network
devices, or even a user report.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Once and indicator alarm has been triggered, an SOC member must respond
and investigate. In the best case scenario the indicator is telling you
that an incident has been detected before too much damage has been done.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 9.4. Response {#_response}

::: {.paragraph}
In the response phase, the SOC deals with an incident to mitigate the
harm it causes. Every incident is different, but the governing
principles and steps are the same.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.4.1. Business Continuity {#_business_continuity}

::: {.paragraph}
The concept of continuity is central to the steps taken to respond to an
incident. Remember that the goal is to keep things running and keep
services available. Business Continuity has three main parts: Business
Continuity Planning (BCP), Business Impact Analysis (BIA), and Disaster
Recovery Planning (DRP).
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Business Continuity Planning (BCP) is a methodology for keeping things
running. With BCP threats are identified in advance and critical
business processes are prioritized. Recovery procedures for these
processes have been developed and tested. In response to an incident,
these procedures are followed as practiced.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Business Impact Analysis (BIA) identifies business functions and rates
the impact of an outage on these functions. BIA measures the impact of
an outage on:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   Property (tangible assets)

-   Finance (monetary funding)

-   Safety (physical protection)

-   Reputation (status)

-   Life (well being)

-   Customers
:::

::: {.paragraph}
BIA can help pinpoint mission-essential functions and single points of
failure. This allows SOCs to determine where there resources should go
in terms of having the best chance of maintaining business continuity.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Finally having a Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) makes it easier to recover
in the case of a large-scale issue. Disaster Recovery (DR) entails
policies, tools, and procedures to recover from an outage. DRPs will
detail order of restoration and require a lot of testing to ensure that
the entire suite of supported applications can be brought back up. A
standard DRP will detail:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   Purpose and Scope

-   Recovery Team

-   Preparing for a Disaster

-   Emergency Procedures or Incident Response During an Incident

-   Restoration Procedures and Return to Normal
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.4.2. Redundancy {#_redundancy}

::: {.paragraph}
Redundant services can help with continuity by making sure there is
always an uncompromised service available. The key concepts of
redundancy are detailed within the language it uses:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Redundancy

:   extra components/services that run in case of failures

Failover

:   the process of turning over to a secondary device

High availability (HA)

:   ensures high level of operation performance

Fault tolerance

:   allows a system to continue in the event of a failure

Single Point of Failure (SPOF)

:   a single failure that can cause an outage
:::

::: {.sect4}
##### Hot, Cold, & Warm {#_hot_cold_warm}

::: {.paragraph}
One typical way to implement redundancy is through the use of hot, cold,
and warm sites.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A hot site is a secondary location that is live and replicating in
real-time what is happening in production. In the case of the primary
site going down, a hot site can failover immediately.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A cold site is a secondary location without equipment. A cold site will
take some time to set up and configure in the case of an outage.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A warm site is a secondary location with all equipment and connectivity.
The equipment will still need to be turned on and made production ready,
but it will not take as long to failover to a warm site as a cold one.
:::
:::

::: {.sect4}
##### RAID {#_raid}

::: {.paragraph}
RAID is an interesting case of redundancy that occurs at the server
storage level. RAID stands for Redundant Array of
Inexpensive/Independent Disks and as the name states it uses multiple
disks to make reads/writes faster *and* to be able to recover if one of
the disks fails. It is important to note that RAID is not a backup.
Backups are meant to aid in recovery and can be co-located. A RAID array
is mean to work on a single machine and help mitigate damages cause by
disk failures.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
RAID has multiple levels, each of which prioritizes a different aspect:
:::

::: {.ulist}
-   RAID 0: Data is stripped across multiple disks to make reads/writes
    faster. If a single disk is lost *the whole array goes down*.

-   RAID 1: Data is mirrored across multiple disks for redundancy. If a
    single disk is lost the array can be recovered from the other disks.

-   RAID 5: At least three disks are used in a stripped and mirrored
    fashion such that read/write speeds are increased *and* if a
    *single* disk goes down the array can be rebuilt.

-   RAID 10: A combination of RAID0 and RAID1.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.4.3. Isolation and Containment {#_isolation_and_containment}

::: {.paragraph}
The first step in reaction to an incident is to remove the asset from
the network so that the damage does not spread. It is standard procedure
for malware to attempt to spread to other machines and the fastest way
for it to do that is through an internal network. By isolating the
infected asset, we can help prevent this.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
There are a few other tools for containing malware such as sandboxing
and snapshots. Sandboxing refers to the practice of running processes in
a controlled environment on a machine. Most web browsers sandbox the
JavaScript they run, meaning that if a website is serving malicious JS
it should not be able to affect anything else on the machine. Snapshots
refer to periodically saving the state of the storage device on a
machine. This allows the SOC to roll the machine back to a previous
state, before malware was active.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.4.4. Recovery {#_recovery}

::: {.paragraph}
Recovery can be a long process, but it is the core of responding to an
incident. If it is possible to remove malware from a machine, that
action is taken in this step. Breached accounts are also disabled.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Unfortunately it may be impossible to roll back some assets to a
previously uncompromised state, in which case they may need to be
restored from a backup or failing that rebuilt from the ground up.
Backups make recovery much simpler and companies that do not have a
backup plan typically implement them after their first incident. That
being said, malware may have also found its way into the backups if
given enough time on the system. In that case the asset is typically
destroyed and a new one is built. While this can take a long time, it is
one of the few ways to know for sure that the asset isn't compromised.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.4.5. Remediation {#_remediation}

::: {.paragraph}
Remediation is focused on making sure that an incident can't happen
again. Remediation may entail patches, firewall changes, IoC database
updates, or even adding more layers of security. The goal is to ensure
that all assets are safe.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.4.6. Reporting {#_reporting}

::: {.paragraph}
Reporting is a critical step. It is important to collect timestamped
logs as well as accounts of how the incident plans were rolled out. This
can help you determine if the plans should be changed and can help you
know what to look for in the future. In the best case scenario good
reporting lets you catch future precursors before they become incidents.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Disclosure is also an important aspect of the reporting phase. Both
compliance and basic ethics mandate that customers be made aware of any
data lost. By disclosing the details of an incident you can also other
companies aware of what types of attacks are occurring \"in the wild.\"
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 9.5. MITRE ATT&CK Framework {#_mitre_attck_framework}

::: {.paragraph}
In the [Malware](index.html#_malware) chapter we covered Lockheed
Martin's Cyber Killchain attack analysis framework. Cyber killchain is
not the only analysis framework available, a popular alternative is the
[MITRE ATT&CK framework](https://attack.mitre.org). ATT&CK has 14
sections that cover adversarial tactics, techniques, and common
knowledge. Each section is separated into different matrices that have
their own sub-techniques.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Developed in 2013, the ATT&CK framework is a modern way of looking at an
incident that can help drive decision making regarding response and
continuity.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.1. Reconnaissance {#_reconnaissance}

::: {.paragraph}
Reconnaissance is the act of collecting information about a target. This
typically involves vulnerability scanning, network mapping, and
phishing. Attackers are generally looking for weak links and a way in to
the company. Understanding how reconnaissance is performed can help a
security team pick up on the precursors to an incident.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.2. Resource Development {#_resource_development}

::: {.paragraph}
Resource development involves acquiring infrastructure from which to
deploy an attack. This may involve impersonation or custom tailoring
exploits based on the results of the previous reconnaissance. In the
resource development phase, all the actions needed to set the stage for
an attack are performed.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.3. Initial Access {#_initial_access}

::: {.paragraph}
Initial access refers to the first breach of security. There are many
ways for this to occur, but some common ones are phishing, someone
clicks on a link in an email, or through a compromised accounts.
Attackers may find it easier to exploit the underlying software a
corporation uses as is the case in a supply chain attack. There are even
instances of attackers leaving rogue flash drives in common areas or
attacking WiFi networks from nearby cars.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
However it is performed, initial access is the first real compromise in
an attack.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.4. Execution {#_execution}

::: {.paragraph}
Execution involves running the commands or scripts needed to perform the
rest of the attack. Much of this may be automated through PowerShell or
BASH scripts. These scripts will exploit vulnerability, setup tasks to
run, download and install software, and possibly even give attackers a
foothold for internal spearphishing.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.5. Persistence {#_persistence}

::: {.paragraph}
Persistence is the act of setting up a system or systems to continue to
run the malware that has been implanted. This may involve autostart
execution of scripts, init scripts on a Linux system, creating new
accounts, scheduling tasks to run, or even implanting the code within or
in place of another executable or macro-enabled document. With
persistence, the attacker can be sure that even if the machine is
restarted or not fully wiped the malicious code will run again.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.6. Privilege Escalation {#_privilege_escalation_2}

::: {.paragraph}
Once an attacker has a foothold on the internal network they will
typically work to elevate privilege. This may be done locally, through
an exploit, by tricking the user into elevating the privileges of a
running script, by stealing credentials over-the-wire, or by leveraging
running system processes.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The key in this phase is that the security of the machine has been
breached, but if the attacker does not have an admin account on the
machine the actual extend of the damage may not be that bad. By
elevating the privilege to an admin the attacker can fully control the
asset.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.7. Defense Evasion {#_defense_evasion}

::: {.paragraph}
It is important to note that while this is occurring, malware scanners,
endpoint management software, and possibly even members of the SOC will
be actively working to detect and remove malware. An attacker will take
steps, typically automated, to make it had to detect their presence.
This may involve disabling malware scanners, clearing logs, deploying in
a container, running within an already running process, and other
methods of obfuscation. Defense evasion makes the job of the security
team that much harder.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.8. Credential Access {#_credential_access}

::: {.paragraph}
With malware running on at least one machine, an attacker may attempt to
steal credentials. This could involve logging key strokes, performing
MitM attacks n the local network, brute force programs, cracking locally
stored hashes, or exploiting password managers. Credentials give an
attacker a means to log in to other machines on the network and expand
their assets.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.9. Discovery {#_discovery}

::: {.paragraph}
A malicious actor will try to collect as much information as possible
about the environment in which they are operating. Knowing about
available accounts, types of network traffic, running services, stored
passwords, and security countermeasures help them make informed
decisions regarding next steps. Internal policies can also be helpful,
it's much easier to guess passwords when you know the company password
policy. Expect that at some point after initial access, an attacker will
try to gain more information.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.10. Lateral Movement {#_lateral_movement}

::: {.paragraph}
Lateral movement refers to moving across internal systems without any
major change in privilege. This may refer to a compromised user account
being used to compromise other user accounts. The more accounts an
attacker has access to, the more effectively they can learn about the
environment. Having access to multiple accounts also gives the attacker
more options for persistence, credential access, and internal
spearphishing.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.11. Collection {#_collection}

::: {.paragraph}
Data can be collected from workstation keyboards, as well as laptop
cameras and microphones. Local system data, shared drive data, and
removable media data can all be harvested as well. Emails can be skimmed
and stored and in some instances screen recordings may also be employed.
Much like in Discovery an attacker is often after as much data as they
can possibly collect.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.12. Command and Control {#_command_and_control}

::: {.paragraph}
Command and Control (C2 or C&C) refers to the process of setting up a
channel between the compromised internal systems and an external system.
This channel can be used to get data off the compromised machines and/or
for putting malware on the machines. A C2 channel allows the operator to
send interact with the compromised machines and even automate much of
the work.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
C2 protocols may try to piggyback on regular network traffic, or make
use of services that are hard to trace. You'll see encrypted C2 traffic
on web protocols, DNS queries, mail protocols, or even chat protocols
such as Discord. Lower level protocols like ICMP and UDP can also be
used to avoid detection. C2 systems may make use of multiple channels or
different channels for uploads/downloads. The ultimate goal is to make
the traffic hard to detect, trace, and stop.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.13. Exfiltration {#_exfiltration}

::: {.paragraph}
Getting the data off of a machine can be difficult for an adversary as
large transfers may trigger alarms. Web services that are already used,
Google Drive, Dropbox, etc., may be employed to make exfiltration look
like regular traffic. In the case of a physical breach, USB drives may
be employed. Finally radio protocols like Bluetooth, cellular, or local
WiFi may also be used if the attacker is in close proximity to the
device.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 9.5.14. Impact {#_impact}

::: {.paragraph}
The impact of the attack needs to be analyzed as well. The impact can
include losing access to the asset, loss of data, data held for ransom,
defacement, denial of service, or resource hijacking. All of these
things can interrupt business continuity and ultimately cost a company
money. The impact of an attack needs to be well understood to make
security decisions in the future.

10. Virtualization {#_virtualization}
------------------

::: {.sectionbody}
::: {.paragraph}
Information Technology has seen massive growth in the adoption of
virtualization as the underpinning of dynamic and robust systems. This
shift from bare-metal resources to virtual resources provides its own
unique security challenges and considerations. As the field changes, it
is important for anyone working in cybersecurity to not only understand
how these systems work, but also be able to approach their
implementation with a security-first mindset.
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 10.1. Methods {#_methods}

::: {.paragraph}
Virtualization is the act of using virtual computing resources as
opposed to the actual resources directly. For example, you may run a
program on a virtual version of a computer, emulating the processor,
memory, etc., instead of running the program directly on the actual
hardware. This offers some advantages in that you can limit the
resources the program uses or run multiple programs in isolated
environments without needing to significantly change the program itself.
There are a few ways that virtual computing is typically accomplished:
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.1.1. Virtual Machines {#_virtual_machines}

::: {.imageblock .right}
::: {.content}
![vm](images/vm.svg){width="400" height="704"}
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
A virtual machine is a resource that uses software to *pretend* to be an
entire physical computer. Virtual machines emulate hardware on which a
*guest* operating system is installed. The operating system of the
machine *running* the virtual machine is referred to as the *host*
operating system.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Virtual machines afford a great deal of flexibility in how something is
run. The machine can be paused, restarted, or even have snapshots of its
current state stored. Some virtual machines do not even required
elevated privileges to run, meaning you can emulate a privileged
environment within an unprivileged one. This makes them a great choice
for sandboxing untrusted programs.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Unfortunately virtual machines are quite resource intensive due to the
fact they require virtualizing the entire operating system. This
resource use problem and the increasing popularity of virtualization led
to the creation of more light-weight solutions such as containers.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.1.2. Containers {#_containers}

::: {.paragraph}
A container simplifies the VM by using the same operating system kernel
as the host. This is accomplished by using special features of the Linux
kernel to isolate the container. [Linux
namespaces](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/namespaces.7.html)
controlled by
[cgroups](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/cgroups.7.html) allow a
daemon (Docker, podman, etc.) to make an environment where the
application has limited access to the full system. Typically containers
are used to run a single application as if it were running all by itself
on an actual host. This makes it easier to deploy the unique
environments that some applications require.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
The obvious security concern lies in the isolation. What happens if a
container has access to another containers resources? Given that
containers for rival companies may be running next to each other on the
same machine in the cloud, what are the risks of having a malicious
container access or disrupt another?
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.1.3. Container Orchestration Systems {#_container_orchestration_systems}

::: {.paragraph}
Containers also make it easier to restart or scale applications.
Container orchestration systems leverage this by monitoring containers
and bringing them up or down as needed. The most popular container
orchestration system is [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), developed
by Google to manage web applications.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Given the orchestration systems create containers from images as needed,
one of the obvious areas of concern is the integrity of those images. If
an image registry is compromised the orchestration system will still
deploy the images stored there typically making the issue far worse.
Containers can also be hard to manage from a logging standpoint, which
may cause compliance issues. Whereas a company may have monitored the
logs of a single server in the past, they now have to monitor the logs
of hundreds of containers running on a server.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.1.4. IaaS {#_iaas}

::: {.paragraph}
IaaS stands for infrastructure as a service and it refers to purchasing
VMs or container resources from a provider. Some popular IaaS companies
are Amazon Web Systems, Microsoft Azure, and Linode. Each has some basic
security tools and default policies in place to help keep the purchased
resources secure, but ultimately most of the security responsibility for
making sure the resources are secure lies with the group purchasing the
resource.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.1.5. PaaS {#_paas}

::: {.paragraph}
PaaS stands for platform as a service and refers to a higher-level
service that deploys an application in an already established
environment running on an IaaS service. Heroku is a great example of
this type of service.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Heroku supports many different applications, but they all work in
relatively the same manner: Imagine there is a git repository of a
Django web application that needs to be deployed. Heroku will take an
Amazon EC2 instance running on AWS, clone the repo, install a Python
virtual environment with the needed dependencies, and install a
production Django web server on the system.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
While the user could take these steps themselves, PaaS makes it easier
to deploy an application.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.1.6. SaaS {#_saas}

::: {.paragraph}
Software as a service (SaaS) is a methodology that we are quite used to.
SaaS takes a web application and makes it available for a subscription.
Some examples would be Webex, Dropbox, Google Workspace, etc. SaaS is a
popular way to monitize software.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
One of the security concerns with SaaS is that it consolidates
information with a single provider. If the server running the software
is compromised, the PII of millions of people may be leaked.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 10.2. Cloud Computing {#_cloud_computing}

::: {.paragraph}
IaaS ushered in a shift from on-premises deployments of software to
deployments *in the cloud* or on a IaaS resource. Information technology
has seen a shift to the cloud and back again with all kinds of mixed
options in between. A business may choose any of these models depending
on their needs.
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.2.1. Public {#_public}

::: {.paragraph}
Public cloud infrastructure consists of providers like AWS who host huge
data centers throughout the world and welcome anyone who can afford it
to use their resources. Public cloud providers claim to be secure and
may even allow for audits (typically through a third party) to meet
compliance requests. Ultimately the security of the underlying public
cloud infrastructure lies in the hands of the provider, something that
not all companies are comfortable with.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.2.2. Private {#_private}

::: {.paragraph}
Private cloud takes the virtualization and automation technologies used
by public cloud providers and hosts them internally. By utilizing
technologies like
[OpenStack](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/openstack) a company can
take full control of their deployment and run their own cloud. This has
some disadvantages for companies that may lack the servers, space, and
utilities, but for companies that were already self-hosted, migrated to
the public cloud, and now would like more control, private cloud is an
excellent choice.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.2.3. Hybrid {#_hybrid}

::: {.paragraph}
Hybrid cloud uses both models, public and private, and hosts some things
on public IaaS services and other on internal, private IaaS services.
This can be the best of both worlds, assuming the applications being
supported leverage the full advantages of their environment.
:::
:::

::: {.sect3}
#### 10.2.4. Multi-Cloud {#_multi_cloud}

::: {.paragraph}
Multi-cloud typically refers to utilizing more than one cloud provider.
This may be required for applications that wish to remain available even
if their cloud provider fails. Multi-cloud also avoids the issue of
vendor lock-in, where the application is only set up to run on one
provider.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
From a security standpoint, multi-cloud likely increases the attack
surface of an application. You now have to be concerned with the
vulnerabilities of two providers instead of just one. This must be
weighed against the benefits of redundancy when deciding whether or not
to utilize more than one cloud provider.
:::
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 10.3. Serverless Solutions {#_serverless_solutions}

::: {.paragraph}
One interesting outcome of the move to virtualized technologies is the
advent of *serverless* solutions. A cloud user might not want to have to
admin an entire Linux server, or even a Linux container just to run
their application. They may be willing to design the application to work
directly within a system that the cloud provider creates.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
[Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is an example of such a
system. Users create functions which run seemingly on their own, without
worrying about the underlying systems supporting them. From a security
standpoint, this places a lot of trust in the provider.
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 10.4. 4C's of Cloud Native Security {#_4cs_of_cloud_native_security}

::: {.paragraph}
When reflecting on how to secure an application running in the cloud, a
common tactic is to look at the four Cs involved:
:::

::: {.dlist}

Code

:   How secure is the code of the application? Is it configured
    correctly? Is it subject to buffer overflows or other issues? If the
    code isn't secure, the application never will be

Container

:   How secure is the container itself? Are there limits to what the
    container has access to? Does the Linux distribution on the
    container have known vulnerabilities? Is the code running as a
    privileged user on the container?

Cluster

:   The container orchestration system is going to run on a cluster, how
    secure is this cluster? Has the container orchestration system been
    configured correctly? Is the virtual network being used secure? Are
    its ingress and egress points mapped and monitored?

Cloud

:   Is the cloud provider you are using secure? If they have are
    compromised everything within them is compromised. Can you trust
    this computing base?
:::
:::

::: {.sect2}
### 10.5. Lab: Malicious Containers {#_lab_malicious_containers}

::: {.paragraph}
While containers have made it much easier to deploy software, they have
also made it easier to deploy *malicious* software. Imagine that we have
an internal company website, written in PHP and deployed in a Docker
container. Given the layered nature of the Docker build system, this
application is *trusting* that the images it is building from are
secure. Take a look at the following `Dockerfile` to see just how easy
it is to slip something malicious into the image:
:::

::: {.listingblock}
::: {.content}
``` {.highlight}
FROM php:apache
COPY shell.php /var/www/html/shell.php
COPY index.php /var/www/html/index.php
```
:::
:::

::: {.paragraph}
`shell.php` is a shell written in PHP that will execute with the
permissions of the web server. This means it will be able to read and
write (but not overwrite) in the /var/www/html directory.
:::

::: {.paragraph}
Let's download, build, and run this image. Download [the malicious.zip
file](https://github.com/rxt1077/it230/raw/main/labs/malicious.zip),
unzip it in a directory where you have write access, and navigate to
that directory in your shell.

### 10.6. Review Questions {#virt_review}

::: {.qlist .qanda}
1.  *Why might a company choose to deploy an application on the public
    cloud? Does this entail any new security considerations?*

2.  *Which type of service requires more trust in the provider, IaaS or
    PaaS? Why?*

3.  *How do the 4C's of cloud native security reflect the principle of
    *layered security*? Do any of the layers overlap?*

being used as a tool to explain what hashes are.
